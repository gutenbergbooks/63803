<h2>AMERICAN PREFACE TO THE
INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC SERIES.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rapid development of science in the present age,
and the increasing public interest in its results, make it
desirable that the most efficient measures should be
adopted to elevate the character of its popular literature.
The tendency of careless and unscrupulous book-makers
to cater to public ignorance and love of the marvellous,
and to foist their crude productions upon those who are
too little instructed to judge of their real quality, has
hitherto been so strong as to cast discredit upon the idea
of "popular science." It is highly important to counteract
this evil tendency by furnishing the public with popular
scientific books of a superior character. The publication
of the present volume is the first step in carrying
out a systematic enterprise of this kind. It initiates a
series of such works on a wide range of scientific subjects,
to be prepared by the leading thinkers of different
countries, and known as the "<span class="smcap">International Scientific Series</span>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span></p>

<p>It is designed to consist of compendious scientific
treatises, representing the latest advances of thought
upon subjects of general interest, theoretical and practical,
to all classes of readers. The familiar phenomena
of surrounding Nature, in their physical and chemical
aspects, the knowledge of which has recently undergone
marked extension or revision, will be considered in their
latest interpretations. Biology, or the general science
of life, which has lately come into prominence, will be
explained in its leading and most important principles.
The subject of mind, which, under the inductive method
and on the basis of its physical accompaniments and conditions,
is giving rise to a new psychology, will be treated
with the fulness to which it is entitled. The laws of
man's social development, or the natural history of society,
which are now being studied by the scientific
method, will also receive a due share of attention. While
the books of this series are to deal with a wide diversity
of topics, it will be a leading object of the enterprise to
present the bearings of inquiry upon the higher questions
of the time, and to throw the latest light of science
upon the phenomena of human nature and the economy
of human life.</p>

<p>As the first requisite of such a series of works is trustworthiness,
their preparation has been confided only to
men of eminent ability, and who are recognized authorities
in their several departments. As they are to address
the non-scientific public, it is a further requisite that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
they should be written in familiar and intelligible language.
It is not to be expected that the authors will
all attain to the same standard in this respect, but they
are pledged to the utmost simplicity of exposition that is
possible consistently with clear and accurate representation.</p>

<p>As science is now the supreme interest of civilization,
and concerns alike the people of every country, and as,
moreover, it affords a common ground upon which men
of all races, tongues, faiths, and nationalities, may work
together in harmony, it seemed fitting that an undertaking
of this kind should be of comprehensive scope
and stand upon an international basis. With the growing
sentiment of sympathy and brotherhood among the
most widely-separated students of Nature, and the extensive
facilities of business intercourse that now exist, there
appeared no reason why an international combination of
authors and publishers should not be effected that would
be equally favourable to their own private interests and
advantageous to the public. To gain this end and guarantee
to authors better remuneration for their work, is a
distinctive purpose of the present enterprise. But there
was this difficulty in the way of any such arrangement,
that, while the rights of foreign authors are guarded by
all other civilized governments, they are not protected
by the government of the United States. To escape
this difficulty, and secure American coöperation, the first
thing needed was to obtain the consent of an American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
publishing-house to grant voluntarily to foreign authors
the justice which our government denies them. It was
agreed by Messrs. Appleton that they would pay the foreign
contributors to this series the full rates of copyright
that are usually allowed to American authors. When
this was done, engagements were made with distinguished
scientists of England, France, Germany, and the United
States, to prepare works for the series, and with Henry
S. King &amp; Co., of London, Germer Baillière, of Paris,
and Messieurs Brockhaus, of Leipsic, to publish them.
Negotiations are pending for the reproduction of the
series in other countries, but the present arrangements
secure to the authors the benefits of the four leading
markets of the world.</p>

<p>It is a fact not without significance, that the proposal
of this enterprise was received with the most cordial
favour by the eminent scientific men who were solicited
to aid in carrying it forward. Most of them consented
at once; but, while some were so heavily burdened with
work that they could enter into no immediate engagements,
not one of them declined to coöperate, and all
promised to do so at the earliest practicable opportunity.
The feeling of the desirableness of such an undertaking
was strong and unanimous. The old dislike of the cultivators
of science to participate in the work of popular
teaching, seems very much to have passed away; and in
England, France, and Germany, alike it was freely acknowledged
that <i>savants</i> have an imperative duty to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
discharge in relation to the work of general scientific
education. As remarked by Prof. Virchow, of Berlin,
"the destiny of science is the service of humanity."</p>

<p>It was stipulated by the authors that they should have
ample time for the preparation of their books, and, as
the arrangements were recently made, only a few of the
works are yet ready. Several, however, are now in
press, and will shortly appear.</p>

<p>Those interested in the series are under many obligations
to Prof. Tyndall for his kindness in consenting
to furnish its commencing volume. Being prepared in
a short time, amid great pressure both of laboratory and
literary work, it contains somewhat less matter than may
be expected in the ensuing volumes. It treats of subjects
upon which he is perhaps the highest living authority;
and it is an admirable example of that vivid, stirring,
impressive style for which its author is so distinguished.
Prof. Tyndall is not only a master in the
"scientific use of the imagination," but in kindling the
action of that faculty in his readers. He writes in pictures,
so as to make them see what he sees. In this
volume he addresses himself directly to his juvenile
friends, groups them around him, takes them with him
to his favourite mountains, and thus adds a dramatic
element and the effect of personal sympathy to familiar
colloquial exposition.</p>

<p>The "<span class="smcap">International Scientific Series</span>" will form
an elegant and valuable library of popular science, fresh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
in treatment, attractive in form, strong in character,
moderate in price, and indispensable to all who care for
the acquisition of solid and serviceable knowledge; and
it is commended to American readers as a help in the
important work of sound public education.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> an absence of twelve years, I visited the Mer
de Glace last June. It exhibited in a striking degree
that excess of consumption over supply which, if continued,
would eventually reduce the Swiss glaciers to the
mere spectres of their former selves. When I first saw
the Mer de Glace its ice-cliffs towered over Les Mottets,
and an arm of the Arveiron, issuing from the cliffs,
plunged as a powerful cascade down the rocks. The ice
has now shrunk far behind them. A huge moraine, left
behind by the retreating glacier, will mark, for some
time to come, its recent magnitude. The vault of the
Arveiron has dwindled considerably. The way up to the
Chapeau lies on the top of a lateral moraine, reached a
few years ago by the surface of the glacier, the present
surface lying far below. The visible and continual
breaking away of the moraines, left thus stranded on the
mountain flank, explains the absence of ancient ridges on
the mountains where the slopes are steep. The ice-cascades
of the Géant has suffered much from the general
waste. Its crevasses are still wild, but the ice-cliffs and
séracs of former days are but poorly represented to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>The great Aletsch and its neighbours exhibit similar
evidences of diminution. I found moreover this year
that the two ancient moraines mentioned in paragraph
364 are parts of the same great lateral moraine which
flanked the glacier for a long period, during which its
magnitude must have remained practically constant.
The place occupied by the ancient ice-river is rendered
strikingly conspicuous by this well-preserved boundary.</p>

<p>During my residence at the Bel Alp this year, a
catastrophe occurred which renders, for the time being,
the description of the Märgelin See given in § 50 inappropriate.
In company with two young friends I had
descended the glacier and passed through the gorge of
the Massa. On our return to the Bel Alp we found the
domestics of the hotel leaning out of the windows and
looking excitedly towards the glacier. From it proceeded
a sound which resembled the roar of a cataract.
The servants remarked that the Märgelin See must
have broken loose. This was the case. For a time,
however, the water flowed beneath the glacier; but at
a point about midway between the Bel Alp and the
Æggischhorn, it broke forth on the Æggischhorn side,
and formed a torrent between the glacier and the slope
of the mountain. In some places this river was more
than sixty yards wide, at others it was contracted to
less than one-fifth of this width. Broken cascades of
great height were formed here and there by successive
ledges of ice, the torrent leaping with indescribable fury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
from ledge to ledge, and sending a smoke of spray into
the air. At one place the bottom of the torrent was
deep soft sand, which, after the water had passed, could
be seen to have been tortured into huge funnels by the
whirling eddies overhead.</p>

<p>Soon after we reached the Bel Alp, on the occasion
just referred to, the front of the torrent appeared
at the opposite side of the valley carrying everything
movable before it, and immediately afterwards swept
through the hollow that we had traversed a little
earlier in the day. When at the end of the glacier I
was struck by the force and volume of the Massa, and
the grandeur of its vault, but I could not then account
for the huge blocks of ice which it incessantly carried
down. Doubtless the eruption above had been partial
before the grand rush set in. The Rhone was considerably
swollen, crops were damaged or ruined, and
the driver of the diligence was sorely perplexed to find
himself in three feet of water, without any apparent
reason, on the public highway. Two or three days
subsequently I learned at the Æggischhorn that an
engineer had been sent up to report on the possibility
of opening a channel, so as to prevent any future accumulation
of water in the Märgelin See. If this be
done a useful end will be gained, by the abolition, however,
of one of the most beautiful objects in Switzerland.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />


<p><span class="smcap">At a meeting</span> of the Managers of the <span class="smcap">Royal Institution</span>
held on December 12, 1825, "the Committee
appointed to consider what lectures should be delivered
in the Institution in the next session," reported "that
they had consulted Mr. Faraday on the subject of engaging
him to take a part in the juvenile lectures proposed
to be given during the Christmas and Easter
recesses, and they found his avocations were such that
it would be exceedingly inconvenient for him to engage
in such lectures."</p>

<p>At a general monthly meeting of the members of
the Royal Institution, held on December 4, 1826, the
Managers reported "that they had engaged Mr. Wallis
to deliver a course of lectures on Astronomy, adapted to
a juvenile auditory, during the Christmas vacation."</p>

<p>In a report dated April 16, 1827, the Board of
Visitors express "their satisfaction at finding that the
plan of juvenile courses of lectures had been resorted
to. They feel sure that the influence of the Institution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
cannot be extended too far, and that the system of
instructing the younger portion of the community is
one of the most effective means which the Institution
possesses for the diffusion of science."</p>

<p>Faraday's holding aloof was but temporary, for at
Christmas 1827 we find him giving a "Course of Six
Elementary Lectures on Chemistry, adapted to a Juvenile
Auditory."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> There is no record to show that Mr. Wallis gave the Astronomical
lectures referred to, and our librarian believes that the <i>Christmas</i>
courses were opened by Faraday.</p></div>

<p>The Easter lectures were soon abandoned; but from
the date here referred to to the present time the Christmas
lectures have been a marked feature of the Royal
Institution.</p>

<p>In 1871 it fell to my lot to give one of these courses.
I had been frequently invited to write on Glaciers in
encyclopædias, journals, and magazines, but had always
declined to do so. I had also abstained from making
them the subject of a course of lectures, wishing to
take no advantage of my position here, and indeed
to avoid writing a line or uttering a sentence on
the subject for which I could not be held personally
responsible. In view of the discussions which
the subject had provoked, I thought this the fairest
course.</p>

<p>But, in 1871, the time (I imagined) had come
when, without risk of offence, I might tell our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
young people something about the labours of those
who had unravelled for their instruction the various
problems of the ice-world. My lamented friend and
ever-helpful counsellor, Dr. Bence Jones, thought the
subject a good one, and accordingly it was chosen.
Strong in my sympathy with youth, and remembering
the damage done by defective exposition to my own
young mind, I sought, to the best of my ability, to
confer upon these lectures clearness, thoroughness,
and life.</p>

<p>Wishing, moreover, to render them of permanent
value, I wrote out copious Notes of the course, and had
them distributed among the boys and girls. In preparing
these Notes I aimed at nothing less than presenting
to my youthful audience, in a concentrated but
perfectly digestible form, every essential point embraced
in the literature of the glaciers, and some things in
addition, which, derived as they were from my own
recent researches, no book previously published on the
subject contained.</p>

<p>But my theory of education agrees with that of
Emerson, according to which instruction is only half
the battle, what he calls <i>provocation</i> being the other
half. By this he means that power of the teacher,
through the force of his character and the vitality of
his thought, to bring out all the latent strength of his
pupil, and to invest with interest even the driest
matters of detail. In the present instance I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
determined to shirk nothing essential, however dry;
and, to keep my mind alive to the requirements of
my pupil, I proposed a series of ideal ramblings, in
which he should be always at my side. Oddly
enough, though I was here dealing with what might
be called the abstract idea of a boy, I realised his
presence so fully as to entertain for him, before our
excursions ended, an affection consciously warm and
real.</p>

<p>The "Notes" here referred to were at first intended
for the use of my audience alone. At the urgent request
of a friend I slightly expanded them, and converted
them into the little book here presented to the
reader.</p>

<p>The amount of attention bestowed upon the volume
induces me to give this brief history of its origin.</p>

<p>A German critic, whom I have no reason to regard
as specially favourable to me or it, makes the following
remark on the style of the book: "This passion [for the
mountains] tempts him frequently to reveal more of his
Alpine wanderings than is necessary for his demonstrations.
The reader, however, will not find this a disagreeable
interruption of the course of thought; for
the book thereby gains wonderfully in vividness." This,
I would say, was the express aim of the breaks
referred to. I desired to keep my companion fresh as
well as instructed, and these interruptions were so many
breathing-places where the intellectual tension was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
purposely relaxed and the mind of the pupil braced to
fresh action.</p>

<p>Of other criticisms, flattering and otherwise, I forbear
to speak. As regards some of them, indeed, it
would be a reproach to that manliness which I have
sought to encourage in my pupil to return blow for
blow. If the reader be acquainted with them, this will
let him know how I regard them; and if he be not
acquainted with them, I would recommend him to ignore
them, and to form his own judgment of this book.
No fair-minded person who reads it will dream that I,
in writing it, had a thought of acting otherwise than
justly and generously towards my predecessors, the last
of whom, to the grief of all who knew him, has recently
passed away.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_FORMS_OF_WATER" id="THE_FORMS_OF_WATER">THE FORMS OF WATER</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">IN CLOUDS AND RIVERS, ICE AND GLACIERS.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a id="sct_1"></a>§ 1. <i>Clouds, Rains, and Rivers.</i></p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Every</span> occurrence in Nature is preceded by other
occurrences which are its causes, and succeeded by
others which are its effects. The human mind is not
satisfied with observing and studying any natural occurrence
alone, but takes pleasure in connecting every
natural fact with what has gone before it, and with
what is to come after it.</p>

<p>2. Thus, when we enter upon the study of rivers and
glaciers, our interest will be greatly augmented by
taking into account not only their actual appearances,
but also their causes and effects.</p>

<p>3. Let us trace a river to its source. Beginning
where it empties itself into the sea, and following it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
backwards, we find it from time to time joined by
tributaries which swell its waters. The river of course
becomes smaller as these tributaries are passed. It
shrinks first to a brook, then to a stream; this again
divides itself into a number of smaller streamlets,
ending in mere threads of water. These constitute
the source of the river, and are usually found among
hills.</p>

<p>4. Thus the Severn has its source in the Welsh
Mountains; the Thames in the Cotswold Hills; the
Danube in the hills of the Black Forest; the Rhine and
the Rhone in the Alps; the Ganges in the Himalaya
Mountains; the Euphrates near Mount Ararat; the
Garonne in the Pyrenees; the Elbe in the Giant Mountains
of Bohemia; the Missouri in the Rocky Mountains,
and the Amazon in the Andes of Peru.</p>

<p>5. But it is quite plain that we have not yet reached
the real beginning of the rivers. Whence do the
earliest streams derive their water? A brief residence
among the mountains would prove to you that they are
fed by rains. In dry weather you would find the
streams feeble, sometimes indeed quite dried up. In
wet weather you would see them foaming torrents. In
general these streams lose themselves as little threads
of water upon the hill sides; but sometimes you may
trace a river to a definite spring. The river Albula in
Switzerland, for instance, rushes at its origin in considerable
volume from a mountain side. But you very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
soon assure yourself that such springs are also fed by
rain, which has percolated through the rocks or soil,
and which, through some orifice that it has found or
formed, comes to the light of day.</p>

<p>6. But we cannot end here. Whence comes the rain
which forms the mountain streams? Observation
enables you to answer the question. Rain does not
come from a clear sky. It comes from clouds. But
what are clouds? Is there nothing you are acquainted
with which they resemble? You discover at once a
likeness between them and the condensed steam of a
locomotive. At every puff of the engine a cloud is projected
into the air. Watch the cloud sharply: you
notice that it first forms at a little distance from the
top of the funnel. Give close attention and you will
sometimes see a perfectly clear space between the
funnel and the cloud. Through that clear space the
thing which makes the cloud must pass. What, then,
is this thing which at one moment is transparent and
invisible, and at the next moment visible as a dense
opaque cloud?</p>

<p>7. It is the <i>steam</i> or <i>vapour of water</i> from the boiler.
Within the boiler this steam is transparent and invisible;
but to keep it in this invisible state a heat
would be required as great as that within the boiler.
When the vapour mingles with the cold air above the
hot funnel it ceases to be vapour. Every bit of steam
shrinks when chilled, to a much more minute particle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
water. The liquid particles thus produced form a kind
of <i>water-dust</i> of exceeding fineness, which floats in the
air, and is called <i>a cloud</i>.</p>

<p>8. Watch the cloud-banner from the funnel of a
running locomotive; you see it growing gradually less
dense. It finally melts away altogether, and if you
continue your observations you will not fail to notice
that the speed of its disappearance depends upon the
character of the day. In humid weather the cloud hangs
long and lazily in the air; in dry weather it is rapidly
licked up. What has become of it? It has been reconverted
into true invisible vapour.</p>

<p>9. The <i>drier</i> the air, and the <i>hotter</i> the air, the
greater is the amount of cloud which can be thus dissolved
in it. When the cloud first forms, its quantity
is far greater than the air is able to maintain in an invisible
state. But as the cloud mixes gradually with a
larger mass of air it is more and more dissolved, and
finally passes altogether from the condition of a finely-divided
liquid into that of transparent vapour or gas.</p>

<p>10. Make the lid of a kettle air-tight, and permit
the steam to issue from the pipe; a cloud is precipitated
in all respects similar to that issuing from the funnel of
the locomotive.</p>

<p>11. Permit the steam as it issues from the pipe to
pass through the flame of a spirit-lamp, the cloud is instantly
dissolved by the heat, and is not again precipitated.
With a special boiler and a special nozzle the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
experiment may be made more striking, but not more
instructive, than with the kettle.</p>

<p>12. Look to your bedroom windows when the
weather is very cold outside; they sometimes stream with
water derived from the condensation of the aqueous vapour
from your own lungs. The windows of railway
carriages in winter show this condensation in a striking
manner. Pour cold water into a dry drinking-glass on
a summer's day: the outside surface of the glass becomes
instantly dimmed by the precipitation of moisture.
On a warm day you notice no vapour in front of your
mouth, but on a cold day you form there a little cloud
derived from the condensation of the aqueous vapour
from the lungs.</p>

<p>13. You may notice in a ball-room that as long as the
door and windows are kept closed, and the room remains
hot, the air remains clear; but when the doors or windows
are opened a dimness is visible, caused by the precipitation
to fog of the aqueous vapour of the ball-room.
If the weather be intensely cold the entrance of fresh
air may even cause <i>snow</i> to fall. This has been observed
in Russian ball-rooms; and also in the subterranean
stables at Erzeroom, when the doors are opened and
the cold morning air is permitted to enter.</p>

<p>14. Even on the driest day this vapour is never
absent from our atmosphere. The vapour diffused
through the air of this room may be congealed to hoar-frost
in your presence. This is done by filling a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
vessel with a mixture of pounded ice and salt, which
is colder than the ice itself, and which, therefore, condenses
and freezes the aqueous vapour. The surface
of the vessel is finally coated with a frozen fur, so
thick that it may be scraped away and formed into a
snow-ball.</p>

<p>15. To produce the cloud, in the case of the locomotive
and the kettle, <i>heat</i> is necessary. By heating
the water we first convert it into steam, and then by
chilling the steam we convert it into cloud. Is there
any fire in nature which produces the clouds of our atmosphere?
There is: the fire of the sun.</p>

<p>16. Thus, by tracing backward, without any break
in the chain of occurrences, our river from its end to its
real beginnings, we come at length to the sun.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_2">§ 2.</a></p>

<p>17. There are, however, rivers which have sources
somewhat different from those just mentioned. They
do not begin by driblets on a hill side, nor can they be
traced to a spring. Go, for example, to the mouth of
the river Rhone, and trace it backwards to Lyons, where
it turns to the east. Bending round by Chambery, you
come at length to the Lake of Geneva, from which the
river rushes, and which you might be disposed to regard
as the source of the Rhone. But go to the head of the
lake, and you find that the Rhone there enters it, that
the lake is in fact a kind of expansion of the river.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Follow this upwards; you find it joined by smaller rivers
from the mountains right and left. Pass these, and
push your journey higher still. You come at length to
a huge mass of ice the&mdash;end of a glacier&mdash;which fills
the Rhone valley, and from the bottom of the glacier
the river rushes. In the glacier of the Rhone you thus
find the source of the river Rhone.</p>

<p>18. But again we have not reached the real beginning
of the river. You soon convince yourself that this
earliest water of the Rhone is produced by the melting
of the ice. You get upon the glacier and walk upwards
along it. After a time the ice disappears and you come
upon snow. If you are a competent mountaineer you
may go to the very top of this great snow-field, and if
you cross the top and descend at the other side you
finally quit the snow, and get upon another glacier
called the Trift, from the end of which rushes a river
smaller than the Rhone.</p>

<p>19. You soon learn that the mountain snow feeds
the glacier. By some means or other the snow is converted
into ice. But whence comes the snow? Like
the rain, it comes from the clouds, which, as before,
can be traced to vapour raised by the sun. Without
solar fire we could have no atmospheric vapour, without
vapour no clouds, without clouds no snow, and without
snow no glaciers. Curious then as the conclusion may
be, the cold ice of the Alps has its origin in the heat of
the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_3">§ 3.</a> <i>The Waves of Light.</i></p>

<p>20. But what is the sun? We know its size and its
weight. We also know that it is a globe of fire far
hotter than any fire upon earth. But we now enter
upon another enquiry. We have to learn definitely
what is the meaning of solar light and solar heat; in
what way they make themselves known to our senses;
by what means they get from the sun to the earth, and
how, when there, they produce the clouds of our atmosphere,
and thus originate our rivers and our glaciers.</p>

<p>21. If in a dark room you close your eyes and press
the eyelid with your finger-nail, a circle of light will be
seen opposite to the point pressed, while a sharp blow
upon the eye produces the impression of a flash of light.
There is a nerve specially devoted to the purposes of
vision which comes from the brain to the back of the
eye, and there divide into fine filaments, which are
woven together to a kind of screen called the <i>retina</i>.
The retina can be excited in various ways so as to produce
the consciousness of light; it may, as we have
seen, be excited by the rude mechanical action of a blow
imparted to the eye.</p>

<p>22. There is no spontaneous creation of light by
the healthy eye. To excite vision the retina must be
affected by something coming from without. What is
that something? In some way or other luminous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
bodies have the power of affecting the retina&mdash;but
<i>how?</i></p>

<p>23. It was long supposed that from such bodies
issued, with inconceivable rapidity, an inconceivably fine
matter, which flew through space, passed through the
pores supposed to exist in the humours of the eye,
reached the retina behind, and by their shock against
the retina, aroused the sensation of light.</p>

<p>24. This theory, which was supported by the greatest
men, among others by Sir Isaac Newton, was found
competent to explain a great number of the phenomena
of light, but it was not found competent to explain <i>all</i>
the phenomena. As the skill and knowledge of experimenters
increased, large classes of facts were revealed
which could only be explained by assuming that light
was produced, not by a fine matter flying through space
and hitting the retina, but by the shock of minute waves
against the retina.</p>

<p>25. Dip your finger into a basin of water, and cause
it to quiver rapidly to and fro. From the point of disturbance
issue small ripples which are carried forward
by the water, and which finally strike the basin. Here,
in the vibrating finger, you have a source of agitation;
in the water you have a vehicle through which the
finger's motion is transmitted, and you have finally the
side of the basin which receives the shock of the little
waves.</p>

<p>26. In like manner, according to the <i>wave theory</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
light, you have a source of agitation in the vibrating
atoms, or smallest particles, of the luminous body; you
have a vehicle of transmission in a substance which is
supposed to fill all space, and to be diffused through the
humours of the eye; and finally, you have the retina,
which receives the successive shocks of the waves.
These shocks are supposed to produce the sensation of
light.</p>

<p>27. We are here dealing for the most part with
suppositions and assumptions merely. We have never
seen the atoms of a luminous body, nor their motions.
We have never seen the medium which transmits their
motions, nor the waves of that medium. How, then,
do we come to assume their existence?</p>

<p>28. Before such an idea could have taken any real
root in the human mind, it must have been well disciplined
and prepared by observations and calculations of
ordinary wave-motion. It was necessary to know how
both water-waves and sound-waves are formed and
propagated. It was above all things necessary to know
how waves, passing through the same medium, act upon
each other. Thus disciplined, the mind was prepared
to detect any resemblance presenting itself between the
action of light and that of waves. Great classes of
optical phenomena accordingly appeared which could
be accounted for in the most complete and satisfactory
manner by assuming them to be produced by waves, and
which could not be otherwise accounted for. It is

because of its competence to explain all the phenomena
of light that the wave theory now receives universal
acceptance on the part of scientific men.</p>

<p>Let me use an illustration. We infer from the
flint implements recently found in such profusion all
over England and in other countries that they were
produced by men, and also that the Pyramids of Egypt
were built by men, because, as far as our experience
goes, nothing but men could form such implements or
build such Pyramids. In like manner, we infer from
the phenomena of light the agency of waves, because,
as far as our experience goes, no other agency could
produce the phenomena.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_4">§ 4.</a> <i>The Waves of Heat which produce the Vapour of
our Atmosphere and melt our Glaciers.</i></p>

<p>29. Thus, in a general way, I have given you the
conception and the grounds of the conception, which
regards light as the product of wave-motion; but we
must go farther than this, and follow the conception into
some of its details. We have all seen the waves of
water, and we know they are of different sizes different
in length and different in height. When, therefore,
you are told that the atoms of the sun, and of almost
all other luminous bodies, vibrate at different rates, and
produce waves of different sizes, your experience of
water-waves will enable you to form a tolerably clear
notion of what is meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>30. As observed above, we have never seen the light-waves,
but we judge of their presence, their position,
and their magnitude, by their effects. Their lengths
have been thus determined, and found to vary from
about 1/30000th to 1/60000th of an inch.</p>

<p>31. But besides those which produce light, the
sun sends forth incessantly a multitude of waves which
produce no light. The largest waves which the sun
sends forth are of this non-luminous character, though
they possess the highest heating power.</p>

<p id="prg_32">32. A common sunbeam contains waves of all kinds,
but it is possible to <i>sift</i> or <i>filter</i> the beam so as to intercept
all its light, and to allow its obscure heat to pass
unimpeded. For substances have been discovered
which, while intensely opaque to the light-waves, are
almost perfectly transparent to the others. On the other
hand, it is possible, by the choice of proper substances,
to intercept in a great degree the pure heat-waves,
and to allow the pure light-waves free transmission.
This last separation is, however, not so perfect as the
first.</p>

<p>33. We shall learn presently how to detach the one
class of waves from the other class, and to prove that
waves competent to light a fire, fuse metal, or burn
the hand like a hot solid, may exist in a perfectly dark
place.</p>

<p id="prg_34">34. Supposing, then, that we withdraw, in the first
instance the large heat-waves, and allow the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>light-waves
alone to pass. These may be concentrated by
suitable lenses and sent into water without sensibly
warming it. Let the light-waves now be withdrawn,
and the larger heat-waves concentrated in the same
manner; they may be caused to boil the water almost
instantaneously.</p>

<p>35. This is the point to which I wished to lead you,
and which without due preparation could not be understood.
You now perceive the important part played by
these large darkness-waves, if I may use the term, in
the work of evaporation. When they plunge into seas,
lakes, and rivers, they are intercepted close to the surface,
and they heat the water at the surface, thus
causing it to evaporate; the light-waves at the same
time entering to great depths without sensibly heating
the water through which they pass. Not only, therefore,
is it the sun's fire which produces evaporation,
but a particular constituent of that fire, the existence
of which you probably were not aware of.</p>

<p id="prg_36">36. Further, it is these selfsame lightless waves
which, falling upon the glaciers of the Alps, melt the
ice and produce all the rivers flowing from the glaciers;
for I shall prove to you presently that the light-waves,
even when concentrated to the uttermost, are unable
to melt the most delicate hoar-frost; much less would
they be able to produce the copious liquefaction observed
upon the glaciers.</p>

<p>37. These large lightless waves of the sun, as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the heat-waves issuing from non-luminous hot bodies,
are frequently called obscure or invisible heat.</p>

<p>We have here an example of the manner in which
phenomena, apparently remote, are connected together
in this wonderful system of things that we call Nature.
You cannot study a snow-flake profoundly without being
led back by it step by step to the constitution of the sun.
It is thus throughout Nature. All its parts are interdependent,
and the study of any one part completely
would really involve the study of all.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_5">§ 5.</a> <i>Experiments to prove the foregoing Statements.</i></p>

<p>38. Heat issuing from any source not visibly red
cannot be concentrated so as to produce the intense
effects just referred to. To produce these it is necessary
to employ the obscure heat of a body raised to the
highest possible state of incandescence. The sun is
such a body, and its dark heat is therefore suitable
for experiments of this nature.</p>

<p>39. But in the atmosphere of London, and for experiments
such as ours, the heat-waves emitted by coke
raised to intense whiteness by a current of electricity
are much more manageable than the sun's waves.
The electric light has also the advantage that its dark
radiation embraces a larger proportion of the total radiation
than the dark heat of the sun. In fact, the force
or energy, if I may use the term, of the dark waves of
the electric light is fully seven times that of its <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>light-waves.
The electric light, therefore, shall be employed
in our experimental demonstrations.</p>

<p>40. From this source a powerful beam is sent
through the room, revealing its track by the motes floating
in the air of the room; for were the motes entirely
absent the beam would be unseen. It falls upon a concave
mirror (a glass one silvered behind will answer) and
is gathered up by the mirror into a cone of reflected
rays; the luminous apex of the cone, which is the <i>focus</i>
of the mirror, being about fifteen inches distant from its
reflecting surface. Let us mark the focus accurately by
a pointer.</p>

<p>41. And now let us place in the path of the beam a
substance perfectly opaque to light. This substance is
iodine dissolved in a liquid called bisulphide of carbon.
The light at the focus instantly vanishes when the dark
solution is introduced. But the solution is intensely
transparent to the dark waves, and a focus of such
waves remains in the air of the room after the light
has been abolished. You may feel the heat of these
waves with your hand; you may let them fall upon a
thermometer, and thus prove their presence; or, best
of all, you may cause them to produce a current of
electricity, which deflects a large magnetic needle. The
magnitude of the deflection is a measure of the heat.</p>

<p>42. Our object now is, by the use of a more powerful
lamp, and a better mirror (one silvered in front
and with a shorter focal distance), to intensify the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
action here rendered so sensible. As before, the focus
is rendered strikingly visible by the intense illumination
of the dust particles. We will first filter the
beam so as to intercept its dark waves, and then permit
the purely luminous waves to exert their utmost
power on a small bundle of gun-cotton placed at the
focus.</p>

<p>43. No effect whatever is produced. The gun-cotton
might remain there for a week without ignition. Let
us now permit the unfiltered beam to act upon the
cotton. It is instantly dissipated in an explosive flash.
This experiment proves that the light-waves are incompetent
to explode the cotton, while the waves of the
full beam are competent to do so; hence we may conclude
that the dark waves are the real agents in the
explosion.</p>

<p>44. But this conclusion would be only probable; for
it might be urged that the <i>mixture</i> of the dark waves
and the light-waves is necessary to produce the result.
Let us then, by means of our opaque solution, isolate
our dark waves and converge them on the cotton. It
explodes as before.</p>

<p>45. Hence it is the dark waves, and they only, that
are concerned in the ignition of the cotton.</p>

<p>46. At the same dark focus sheets of platinum are
raised to vivid redness; zinc is burnt up; paper instantly
blazes; magnesium wire is ignited; charcoal
within a receiver containing oxygen is set burning; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
diamond similarly placed is caused to glow like a star,
being afterward gradually dissipated. And all this
while the <i>air</i> at the focus remains as cool as in any
other part of the room.</p>

<p>47. To obtain the light-waves we employ a clear
solution of alum in water; to obtain the dark waves
we employ the solution of iodine above referred to.
But as before stated (<a href="#prg_32">32</a>), the alum is not so perfect a
filter as the iodine; for it transmits a portion of the
obscure heat.</p>

<p>48. Though the light-waves here prove their incompetence
to ignite gun-cotton, they are able to burn up
black paper; or, indeed, to explode the cotton when it
is blackened. The white cotton does not absorb the
light, and without absorption we have no heating. The
blackened cotton absorbs, is heated, and explodes.</p>

<p>49. Instead of a solution of alum, we will employ for
our next experiment a cell of pure water, through which
the light passes without sensible absorption. At the
focus is placed a test-tube also containing water, the full
force of the light being concentrated upon it. The
water is not sensibly warmed by the concentrated
waves. We now remove the cell of water; no change
is visible in the beam, but the water contained in the
test-tube now boils.</p>

<p>50. The light-waves being thus proved ineffectual,
and the full beam effectual, we may infer that it is the
dark waves that do the work of heating. But we clench
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
our inference by employing our opaque iodine filter.
Placing it on the path of the beam, the light is entirely
stopped, but the water boils exactly as it did when the
full beam fell upon it.</p>

<p>51. The truth of the statement made in paragraph
(<a href="#prg_34">34</a>) is thus demonstrated.</p>

<p>52. And now with regard to the melting of ice. On
the surface of a flask containing a freezing mixture
we obtain a thick fur of hoar-frost. Sending the
beam through a water-cell, its luminous waves are concentrated
upon the surface of the flask. Not a spicula
of the frost is dissolved. We now remove the water-cell,
and in a moment a patch of the frozen fur as large as
half-a-crown is melted. Hence, inasmuch as the full
beam produces this effect, and the luminous part of the
beam does not produce it, we fix upon the dark portion
the melting of the frost.</p>

<p>53. As before, we clench this inference by concentrating
the dark waves alone upon the flask. The frost
is dissipated exactly as it was by the full beam.</p>

<p>54. These effects are rendered strikingly visible by
darkening with ink the freezing mixture within the
flask. When the hoar-frost is removed, the blackness
of the surface from which it had been melted comes
out in strong contrast with the adjacent snowy whiteness.
When the flask itself, instead of the freezing
mixture, is blackened, the purely luminous waves being
absorbed by the glass, warm it; the glass reacts upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the frost, and melts it. Hence the wisdom of darkening,
instead of the flask itself, the mixture within the flask.</p>

<p>55. This experiment proves to demonstration the
statement in paragraph (<a href="#prg_36">36</a>): that it is the dark waves
of the sun that melt the mountain snow and ice, and
originate all the rivers derived from glaciers.</p>

<p>There are writers who seem to regard science as an
aggregate of facts, and hence doubt its efficacy as an
exercise of the reasoning powers. But all that I have
here taught you is the result of reason, taking its stand,
however, upon the sure basis of observation and experiment.
And this is the spirit in which our further
studies are to be pursued.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_6">§ 6.</a> <i>Oceanic Distillation.</i></p>

<p>56. The sun, you know, is never exactly overhead in
England. But at the equator, and within certain limits
north and south of it, the sun at certain periods of the
year is directly overhead at noon. These limits are
called the Tropics of Cancer and of Capricorn. Upon
the belt comprised between these two circles the sun's
rays fall with their mightiest power; for here they
shoot directly downward, and heat both earth and sea
more than when they strike slantingly.</p>

<p>57. When the vertical sunbeams strike the land they
heat it, and the air in contact with the hot soil becomes
heated in turn. But when heated the air expands, and
when it expands it becomes lighter. This lighter air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
rises, like wood plunged into water, through the heavier
air overhead.</p>

<p>58. When the sunbeams fall upon the sea the water
is warmed, though not so much as the land. The
warmed water expands, becomes thereby lighter, and
therefore continues to float upon the top. This upper
layer of water warms to some extent the air in contact
with it, but it also sends up a quantity of aqueous
vapour, which being far lighter than air, helps the
latter to rise. Thus both from the land and from the
sea we have ascending currents established by the action
of the sun.</p>

<p>59. When they reach a certain elevation in the
atmosphere, these currents divide and flow, part
towards the north and part towards the south; while
from the north and the south a flow of heavier and
colder air sets in to supply the place of the ascending
warm air.</p>

<p>60. Incessant circulation is thus established in the
atmosphere. The equatorial air and vapour flow above
towards the north and south poles, while the polar air
flows below towards the equator. The two currents of
air thus established are called the upper and the lower
trade winds.</p>

<p>61. But before the air returns from the poles great
changes have occurred. For the air as it quitted the
equatorial regions was laden with aqueous vapour,
which could not subsist in the cold polar regions. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
there precipitated, falling sometimes as rain, or more
commonly as snow. The land near the pole is covered
with this snow, which gives birth to vast glaciers in a
manner hereafter to be explained.</p>

<p>62. It is necessary that you should have a perfectly
clear view of this process, for great mistakes have been
made regarding the manner in which glaciers are related
to the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>63. It was supposed that if the sun's heat were
diminished, greater glaciers than those now existing
would be produced. But the lessening of the sun's
heat would infallibly diminish the quantity of aqueous
vapour, and thus cut off the glaciers at their source.
A brief illustration will complete your knowledge here.</p>

<p>64. In the process of ordinary distillation, the liquid
to be distilled is heated and converted into vapour in
one vessel, and chilled and reconverted into liquid in
another. What has just been stated renders it plain
that the earth and its atmosphere constitute a vast distilling
apparatus in which the equatorial ocean plays
the part of the boiler, and the chill regions of the poles
the part of the condenser. In this process of distillation
<i>heat</i> plays quite as necessary a part as <i>cold</i>, and
before Bishop Heber could speak of "Greenland's icy
mountains," the equatorial ocean had to be warmed by
the sun. We shall have more to say upon this question
afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">Illustrative Experiments.</span></p>

<p>65. I have said that when heated, air expands. If
you wish to verify this for yourself, proceed thus. Take
an empty flask, stop it by a cork; pass through the
cork a narrow glass tube. By heating the tube in a
spirit-lamp you can bend it downwards, so that when the
flask is standing upright the open end of the narrow
tube may dip into water. Now cause the flame of
your spirit-lamp to play against the flask. The flame
heats the glass, the glass heats the air; the air expands,
is driven through the narrow tube, and issues in
a storm of bubbles from the water.</p>

<p>66. Were the heated air unconfined, it would rise
in the heavier cold air. Allow a sunbeam or any other
intense light to fall upon a white wall or screen in a dark
room. Bring a heated poker, a candle, or a gas flame
underneath the beam. An ascending current rises from
the heated body through the beam, and the action of the
air upon the light is such as to render the wreathing
and waving of the current strikingly visible upon the
screen. When the air is hot enough, and therefore light
enough, if entrapped in a paper bag it carries the bag
upwards, and you have the Fire-balloon.</p>

<p>67. Fold two sheets of paper into two cones and
suspend them with their closed points upwards from
the end of a delicate balance. See that the cones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
balance each other. Then place for a moment the
flame of a spirit-lamp beneath the open base of one of
them; the hot air ascends from the lamp and instantly
tosses upwards the cone above it.</p>

<p>68. Into an inverted glass shade introduce a little
smoke. Let the air come to rest, and then simply place
your hand at the open mouth of the shade. Mimic hurricanes
are produced by the air warmed by the hand,
which are strikingly visible when the smoke is illuminated
by a strong light.</p>

<p>69. The heating of the tropical air by the sun is
<i>indirect</i>. The solar beams have scarcely any power to
heat the air through which they pass; but they heat
the land and ocean, and these communicate their heat
to the air in contact with them. The air and vapour
start upwards charged with the heat thus communicated.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_7">§ 7.</a> <i>Tropical Rains.</i></p>

<p>70. But long before the air and vapour from the
equator reach the poles, precipitation occurs. Wherever
a humid warm wind mixes with a cold dry one, rain
falls. Indeed the heaviest rains occur at those places
where the sun is vertically overhead. We must enquire
a little more closely into their origin.</p>

<p>71. Fill a bladder about two-thirds full of air at the
sea level, and take it to the summit of Mont Blanc. As
you ascend, the bladder becomes more and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
distended; at the top of the mountain it is fully distended,
and has evidently to bear a pressure from within.
Returning to the sea level you find that the tightness
disappears, the bladder finally appearing as flaccid as
at first.</p>

<p>72. The reason is plain. At the sea level the air
within the bladder has to bear the pressure of the
whole atmosphere, being thereby squeezed into a comparatively
small volume. In ascending the mountain,
you leave more and more of the atmosphere behind;
the pressure becomes less and less, and by its expansive
force the air within the bladder swells as the outside
pressure is diminished. At the top of the mountain
the expansion is quite sufficient to render the bladder
tight, the pressure within being then actually greater
than the pressure without. By means of an air-pump
we can show the expansion of a balloon partly filled
with air, when the external pressure has been in part
removed.</p>

<p>73. But why do I dwell upon this? Simply to make
plain to you that the <i>unconfined air</i>, heated at the earth's
surface, and ascending by its lightness, must expand
more and more the higher it rises in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>74. And now I have to introduce to you a new fact,
towards the statement of which I have been working
for some time. It is this: <i>The ascending air is chilled
by its expansion.</i> Indeed this chilling is one source of
the coldness of the higher atmospheric regions. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
now fix your eye upon those mixed currents of air and
aqueous vapour which rise from the warm tropical ocean.
They start with plenty of heat to preserve the vapour
as vapour; but as they rise they come into regions
already chilled, and they are still further chilled by
their own expansion. The consequence might be foreseen.
The load of vapour is in great part precipitated,
dense clouds are formed, their particles coalesce to
rain-drops, which descend daily in gushes so profuse that
the word "torrential" is used to express the copiousness
of the rainfall. I could show you this chilling
by expansion, and also the consequent precipitation of
clouds.</p>

<p id="prg_75">75. Thus long before the air from the equator reaches
the poles its vapour is in great part removed from it,
having redescended to the earth as rain. Still a good
quantity of the vapour is carried forward, which yields
hail, rain, and snow in northern and southern lands.</p>


<p class="tdc"><span class="smcap">Illustrative Experiments.</span></p>

<p>76. I have said that the air is chilled during its expansion.
Prove this, if you like, thus. With a condensing
syringe, you can force air into an iron box
furnished with a stopcock, to which the syringe is
screwed. Do so till the density of the air within the
box is doubled or trebled. Immediately after this condensation,
both the box and the air within it are warm,
and can be proved to be so by a proper thermometer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Simply turn the cock and allow the compressed air to
stream into the atmosphere. The current, if allowed to
strike the thermometer, visibly chills it; and with other
instruments the chill may be made more evident still.
Even the hand feels the chill of the expanding air.</p>

<p>77. Throw a strong light, a concentrated sunbeam
for example, across the issuing current; if the compressed
air be ordinary humid air, you see the precipitation of a
little cloud by the chill accompanying the expansion.
This cloud-formation may, however, be better illustrated
in the following way:&mdash;</p>

<p>78. In a darkened room send a strong beam of light
through a glass tube three feet long and three inches
wide, stopped at its ends by glass plates. Connect the
tube by means of a stopcock with a vessel of about one-fourth
its capacity, from which the air has been removed
by an air-pump. The exhausted cylinder of the
pump itself will answer capitally. Fill the glass tube
with humid air; then simply turn on the stopcock
which connects it with the exhausted vessel. Having
more room the air expands, cold accompanies the expansion,
and, as a consequence, a dense and brilliant
cloud immediately fills the tube. If the experiment be
made for yourself alone you may see the cloud in ordinary
daylight; indeed, the brisk exhaustion of any
receiver filled with humid air is known to produce this
condensation.</p>

<p>79. Other vapours than that of water may be thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
precipitated, some of them yielding clouds of intense
brilliancy, and displaying iridescences, such as are sometimes,
but not frequently, seen in the clouds floating
over the Alps.</p>

<p>80. In science what is true for the small is true for
the large. Thus by combining the conditions observed
on a large scale in nature we obtain on a small scale the
phenomena of atmospheric clouds.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_8">§ 8.</a> <i>Mountain Condensers.</i></p>

<p>81. To complete our view of the process of atmospheric
precipitation we must take into account the
action of mountains. Imagine a south-west wind
blowing across the Atlantic towards Ireland. In its
passage it charges itself with aqueous vapour. In the
south of Ireland it encounters the mountains of Kerry:
the highest of these is Magillicuddy's Reeks, near
Killarney. Now the lowest stratum of this Atlantic
wind is that which is most fully charged with vapour.
When it encounters the base of the Kerry mountains
it is tilted up and flows bodily over them. Its load of
vapour is therefore carried to a height, it expands on
reaching the height, it is chilled in consequence of the
expansion, and comes down in copious showers of rain.
From this, in fact, arises the luxuriant vegetation of
Killarney; to this, indeed, the lakes owe their water
supply. The cold crests of the mountains also aid in the
work of condensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>82. Note the consequence. There is a town called
Cahirciveen to the south-west of Magillicuddy's Reeks,
at which observations of the rainfall have been made,
and a good distance farther to the north-east, right in
the course of the south-west wind, there is another town,
called Portarlington, at which observations of rainfall
have also been made. But before the wind reaches the
latter station it has passed over the mountains of Kerry
and left a great portion of its moisture behind it.
What is the result? At Cahirciveen, as shown by Dr.
Lloyd, the rainfall amounts to 59 inches in a year, while
at Portarlington it is only 21 inches.</p>

<p>83. Again, you may sometimes descend from the
Alps when the fall of rain and snow is heavy and incessant,
into Italy, and find the sky over the plains of
Lombardy blue and cloudless, the wind at the same time
<i>blowing over the plain towards the Alps</i>. Below the
wind is hot enough to keep its vapour in a perfectly
transparent state; but it meets the mountains, is tilted
up, expanded, and chilled. The cold of the higher
summits also helps the chill. The consequence is that
the vapour is precipitated as rain or snow, thus producing
bad weather upon the heights, while the plains below,
flooded with the same air, enjoy the aspect of the unclouded
summer sun. Clouds blowing <i>from</i> the Alps are
also sometimes dissolved over the plains of Lombardy.</p>

<p id="prg_84">84. In connection with the formation of clouds by
mountains, one particularly instructive effect may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
here noticed. You frequently see a streamer of cloud
many hundred yards in length drawn out from an
Alpine peak. Its steadiness appears perfect, though a
strong wind may be blowing at the same time over the
mountain head. Why is the cloud not blown away?
It is blown away; its permanence is only apparent. At
one end it is incessantly dissolved, at the other end it
is incessantly renewed: supply and consumption being
thus equalized, the cloud appears as changeless as the
mountain to which it seems to cling. When the red
sun of the evening shines upon these cloud-streamers
they resemble vast torches with their flames blown
through the air.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_9">§ 9.</a> <i>Architecture of Snow.</i></p>

<p>85. We now resemble persons who have climbed a
difficult peak, and thereby earned the enjoyment of a
wide prospect. Having made ourselves masters of the
conditions necessary to the production of mountain snow,
we are able to take a comprehensive and intelligent view
of the phenomena of glaciers.</p>

<p>86. A few words are still necessary as to the formation
of snow. The molecules and atoms of all substances,
when allowed free play, build themselves into
definite and, for the most part, beautiful forms called
crystals. Iron, copper, gold, silver, lead, sulphur, when
melted and permitted to cool gradually, all show this
crystallizing power. The metal bismuth shows it in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
particularly striking manner, and when properly fused
and solidified, self-built crystals of great size and beauty
are formed of this metal.</p>

<p>87. If you dissolve saltpetre in water, and allow the
solution to evaporate slowly, you may obtain large crystals,
for no portion of the salt is converted into vapour.
The water of our atmosphere is fresh though it is derived
from the salt sea. Sugar dissolved in water, and
permitted to evaporate, yields crystals of sugar-candy.
Alum readily crystallizes in the same way. Flints dissolved,
as they sometimes are in nature, and permitted
to crystallize, yield the prisms and pyramids of rock
crystal. Chalk dissolved and crystallized yields Iceland
spar. The diamond is crystallized carbon. All our precious
stones, the ruby, sapphire, beryl, topaz, emerald,
are all examples of this crystallizing power.</p>

<p id="prg_88">88. You have heard of the force of gravitation, and
you know that it consists of an attraction of every particle
of matter for every other particle. You know that
planets and moons are held in their orbits by this attraction.
But gravitation is a very simple affair compared
to the force, or rather forces, of crystallization. For
here the ultimate particles of matter, inconceivably small
as they are, show themselves possessed of attractive and
repellent poles, by the mutual action of which the shape
and structure of the crystal are determined. In the
solid condition the attracting poles are rigidly locked together;
but if sufficient heat be applied the bond of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
union is dissolved, and in the state of fusion the poles
are pushed so far asunder as to be practically out of each
other's range. The natural tendency of the molecules
to build themselves together is thus neutralized.</p>

<p>89. This is the case with water, which as a liquid is
to all appearance formless. When sufficiently cooled
the molecules are brought within the play of the crystallizing
force, and they then arrange themselves in
forms of indescribable beauty. When snow is produced
in calm air, the icy particles build themselves into beautiful
stellar shapes, each star possessing six rays. There
is no deviation from this type, though in other respects
the appearances of the snow-stars are infinitely various.
In the polar regions these exquisite forms were observed
by Dr. Scoresby, who gave numerous drawings of them.
I have observed them in mid-winter filling the air, and
loading the slopes of the Alps. But in England they
are also to be seen, and no words of mine could convey so
vivid an impression of their beauty as the annexed drawings
of a few of them, executed at Greenwich by Mr.
Glaisher.</p>

<p>90. It is worth pausing to think what wonderful
work is going on in the atmosphere during the formation
and descent of every snow-shower: what building
power is brought into play! and how imperfect seem
the productions of human minds and hands when compared
with those formed by the blind forces of nature!</p>

<p>91. But who ventures to call the forces of nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
blind? In reality, when we speak thus we are describing
our own condition. The blindness is ours; and what
we really ought to say, and to confess, is that our powers
are absolutely unable to comprehend either the origin
or the end of the operations of nature.</p>

<p>92. But while we thus acknowledge our limits, there
is also reason for wonder at the extent to which science
has mastered the system of nature. From age to age,
and from generation to generation, fact has been added
to fact, and law to law, the true method and order of
the Universe being thereby more and more revealed.
In doing this science has encountered and overthrown
various forms of superstition and deceit, of credulity
and imposture. But the world continually produces
weak persons and wicked persons; and as long as they
continue to exist side by side, as they do in this our day,
very debasing beliefs will also continue to infest the
world.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_10">§ 10.</a> <i>Atomic Poles.</i></p>

<p>93. "What did I mean when, a few moments ago
(<a href="#prg_88">88</a>), I spoke of attracting and repellent poles?" Let
me try to answer this question. You know that astronomers
and geographers speak of the earth's poles, and
you have also heard of magnetic poles, the poles of a
magnet being the points at which the attraction and
repulsion of the magnet are as it were concentrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>94. Every magnet possesses, two such poles; and if
iron filings be scattered over a magnet, each particle
becomes also endowed with two poles. Suppose such
particles devoid of weight and floating in our atmosphere,
what must occur when they come near each other?
Manifestly the repellent poles will retreat from each
other, while the attractive poles will approach and
finally lock themselves together. And supposing the
particles, instead of a single pair, to possess several pairs
of poles arranged at definite points over their surfaces;
you can then picture them, in obedience to their mutual
attractions and repulsions, building themselves together
to form masses of definite shape and structure.</p>

<p>95. Imagine the molecules of water in calm cold air
to be gifted with poles of this description, which compel
the particles to lay themselves together in a definite order,
and you have before your mind's eye the unseen architecture
which finally produces the visible and beautiful
crystals of the snow. Thus our first notions and conceptions
of poles are obtained from the sight of our
eyes in looking at the effects of magnetism; and we
then transfer these notions and conceptions to particles
which no eye has ever seen. The power by which we
thus picture to ourselves effects beyond the range of the
senses is what philosophers call the Imagination, and in
the effort of the mind to seize upon the unseen architecture
of crystals, we have an example of the "scientific
use" of this faculty. Without imagination we might
have <i>critical</i> power, but not <i>creative</i> power in science.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_11">§ 11.</a> <i>Architecture of Lake Ice.</i></p>

<p>96. We have thus made ourselves acquainted with
the beautiful snow-flowers self-constructed by the molecules
of water in calm cold air. Do the molecules show
this architectural power when ordinary water is frozen?
What, for example, is the structure of the ice over
which we skate in winter? Quite as wonderful as the
flowers of the snow. The observation is rare, if not new,
but I have seen in water slowly freezing six-rayed ice-stars
formed, and floating free on the surface. A six-rayed
star, moreover, is typical of the construction of all
our lake ice. It is built up of such forms wonderfully
interlaced.</p>

<p id="prg_97">97. Take a slab of lake ice and place it in the path
of a concentrated sunbeam. Watch the track of the
beam through the ice. Part of the beam is stopped,
part of it goes through; the former produces internal
liquefaction, the latter has no effect whatever upon the
ice. But the liquefaction is not uniformly diffused.
From separate spots of the ice little shining points are
seen to sparkle forth. Every one of those points is surrounded
by a beautiful liquid flower with six petals.</p>

<p>98. Ice and water are so optically alike that unless
the light fall properly upon these flowers you cannot
see them. But what is the central spot? A vacuum.
Ice swims on water because, bulk for bulk, it is lighter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
than water; so that when ice is melted it shrinks in
size. Can the liquid flowers then occupy the whole
space of the ice melted? Plainly no. A little empty
space is formed with the flowers, and this space, or
rather its surface, shines in the sun with the lustre of
burnished silver.</p>

<p>99. In all cases the flowers are formed parallel to
the surface of freezing. They are formed when the
sun shines upon the ice of every lake; sometimes in
myriads, and so small as to require a magnifying glass
to see them. They are always attainable, but their
beauty is often marred by internal defects of the ice.
Even one portion of the same piece of ice may show
them exquisitely, while the second portion shows them
imperfectly.</p>

<p>100. Annexed is a very imperfect sketch of these
beautiful figures.</p>

<p>101. Here we have a reversal of the process of
crystallization. The searching solar beam is delicate
enough to take the molecules down without deranging
the order of their architecture. Try the experiment for
yourself with a pocket-lens on a sunny day. You will
not find the flowers confused; they all lie parallel to
the surface of freezing. In this exquisite way every
bit of the ice over which our skaters glide in winter is
put together.</p>

<p>102. I said in (<a href="#prg_97">97</a>) that a portion of the sunbeam
was stopped by the ice and liquefied it. What is this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
portion? The dark heat of the sun. The great body
of the light waves and even a portion of the dark ones,
pass through the ice without losing any of their heating
power. When properly concentrated on combustible
bodies, even after having passed through the ice, their
burning power becomes manifest.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/page37.png" width="325" height="216" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">LIQUID FLOWERS IN LAKE ICE.</div>
</div>

<p>103. And the ice itself may be employed to concentrate
them. With an ice-lens in the polar regions
Dr. Scoresby has often concentrated the sun's rays so
as to make them burn wood, fire gunpowder, and melt
lead; thus proving that the heating power is retained
by the rays, even after they have passed through so cold
a substance.</p>

<p>104. By rendering the rays of the electric lamp
parallel, and then sending them through a lens of ice,
we obtain all the effects which Dr. Scoresby obtained
with the rays of the sun.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_12">§ 12.</a> <i>The Source of the Arveiron. Ice Pinnacles,
Towers, and Chasms of the Glacier des Bois.
Passage to the Montanvert.</i></p>

<p>105. Our preparatory studies are for the present
ended, and thus informed, let us approach the Alps.
Through the village of Chamouni, in Savoy, a river
rushes which is called the Arve. Let us trace this river
backwards from Chamouni. At a little distance from
the village the river forks; one of its branches still continues
to be called the Arve, the other is the Arveiron.
Following this latter we come to what is called the
"source of the Arveiron"&mdash;a short hour's walk from
Chamouni. Here, as in the case of the Rhone already
referred to, you are fronted by a huge mass of ice, the
end of a glacier, and from an arch in the ice the Arveiron
issues. Do not trust the arch in summer. Its
roof falls at intervals with a startling crash, and would
infallibly crush any person on whom it might fall.</p>

<p>106. We must now be observant. Looking about us
here, we find in front of the ice curious heaps and ridges
of débris, which are more or less concentric. These are
the <i>terminal moraines</i> of the glacier. We shall examine
them subsequently.</p>

<p>107. We now turn to the left, and ascend the slope
beside the glacier. As we ascend we get a better view,
and find that the ice here fills a narrow valley. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
come upon another singular ridge, not of fresh débris,
like those lower down, but covered in part with trees,
and appearing to be literally as "old as the hills." It
tells a wonderful tale. We soon satisfy ourselves that
the ridge is an ancient moraine, and at once conclude
that the glacier, at some former period of its existence,
was vastly larger than it is now. This old moraine
stretches right across the main valley, and abuts against
the mountains at the opposite side.</p>

<p>108. Having passed the terminal portion of the
glacier, which is covered with stones and rubbish, we
find ourselves beside a very wonderful exhibition of ice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
The glacier descends a steep gorge, and in doing so is
riven and broken in the most extraordinary manner.
Here are towers, and pinnacles, and fantastic shapes
wrought out by the action of the weather, which put
one in mind of rude sculpture. Annexed is a sketch
of an ice-pinnacle. From deep chasms in the glacier
issues a delicate shimmer of blue light. At times we
hear a sound like thunder, which arises either from
the falling of a tower of ice, or from the tumble of a
huge stone into a chasm. The glacier maintains this
wild and chaotic character for some time; and the best
iceman would find himself defeated in any attempt to
get along it.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">ICE-PINNACLE.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>109. We reach a place called the Chapeau, where, if
we wish, we can have refreshment in a little mountain
hut. We then pass the <i>Mauvais Pas</i>, a precipitous
rock, on the face of which steps are hewn, and the unpractised
traveller is assisted by a rope. We pursue
our journey, partly along the mountain side, and partly
along a ridge of singularly artificial aspect a <i>lateral
moraine</i>. We at length face a house perched upon an
eminence at the opposite side of the glacier. This is
the auberge of the Montanvert, well known to all visitors
to this portion of the Alps.</p>

<p>110. Here we cross the glacier. I should have told
you that its lower part, including the broken portion
we have passed, is called the Glacier des Bois; while
the place that we are now about to cross is the beginning
of the Mer de Glace. You feel that this term is
not quite appropriate, for the glacier here is much more
like a <i>river</i> of ice than a sea. The valley which it fills
is about half a mile wide.</p>

<p>111. The ice may be riven where we enter upon it,
but with the necessary care there is no difficulty in
crossing this portion of the Mer de Glace. The clefts
and chasms in the ice are called <i>crevasses</i>; we shall make
their acquaintance on a grander scale by and by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p id="prg_112">112. Look up and down this side of the glacier. It
is considerably riven, but as we advance the crevasses
will diminish, and we shall find very few of them at
the other side. Note this for future use. The ice is at
first dirty; but the dirt soon disappears, and you come
upon the clean crisp surface of the glacier. You have
already noticed that the clean ice is white, and that from
a distance it resembles snow rather than ice. This is
caused by the breaking up of the surface by the solar
heat. When you pound transparent rock-salt into powder
it is as white as table-salt, and it is the minute fissuring
of the surface of the glacier by the sun's rays that
causes it to appear white. <i>Within</i> the glacier the ice
is transparent. After an exhilarating passage we get
upon the opposite lateral moraine, and ascend the steep
slope from it to the Montanvert Inn.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_13">§ 13.</a> <i>The Mer de Glace and its Sources. Our First
Climb to the Cleft Station.</i></p>

<p>113. Here the view before us is very grand. We
look across the glacier at the beautiful pyramid of the
Aiguille du Dru (shown in our <a href="#Frontispiece">frontispiece</a>); and to the
right at the Aiguille des Charmoz, with its sharp pinnacles
bent as if they were ductile. Looking straight
up the glacier the view is bounded by the great crests
called La Grande Jorasse, nearly 14,000 feet high. Our
object now is to get into the very heart of the mountains,
and to pursue to its origin the wonderful frozen
river which we have just crossed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>114. Starting from the Montanvert with, the glacier
below us to our left, we soon reach some rocks resembling
the Mauvais Pas; they are called <i>les Fonts</i>. We
cross them and reach <i>l'Angle</i>, where we quit the land for
the ice. We walk up the glacier, but before reaching
the promontory called Trélaporte, we take once more to
the mountain side; for though the path here has been
forsaken on account of its danger, for the sake of knowledge
we are prepared to incur danger to a reasonable
extent. A little glacier reposes on the slope to our
right. We may see a huge boulder or two poised on
the end of the glacier, and, if fortunate, also see the
boulder liberated and plunging violently down the slope.
Presence of mind is all that is necessary to render our
safety certain; but travellers do not always show presence
of mind, and hence the path which formerly led
over this slope has been forsaken. The whole slope is
cumbered by masses of rock which this little glacier has
sent down. These I wished you to see; by and by they
shall be fully accounted for.</p>

<p>115. Above Trélaporte to the right you see a most
singular cleft in the rocks, in the middle of which stands
an isolated pillar, hewn out by the weather. Our next
object is to get to the tower of rock to the left of that
cleft, for from that position we shall gain a most commanding
and instructive view of the Mer de Glace and
its sources.</p>

<p>116. The cleft referred to, with its pillar, may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
seen to the right of the preceding engraving of the Mer
de Glace. Below the cleft is also seen the little glacier
just referred to.</p>

<p>117. We may reach this cleft by a steep gully, visible
from our present position, and leading directly up
to the cleft. But these gullies, or couloirs, are very
dangerous, being the pathways of stones falling from
the heights. We will therefore take the rocks to the
left of the gully, by close inspection ascertain their assailable
points, and there attack them. In the Alps
as elsewhere wonderful things may be done by looking
steadfastly at difficulties, and testing them wherever
they appear assailable. We thus reach our station,
where the glory of the prospect, and the insight that
we gain as to the formation of the Mer de Glace, far
more than repay us for the labour of our ascent.</p>

<p>118. For we see the glacier below us, stretching its
frozen tongue downwards past the Montanvert. And
we now find this single glacier branching out into three
others, some of them wider than itself. Regard the
branch to the right, the Glacier du Géant. It stretches
smoothly up for a long distance, then becomes disturbed,
and then changes to a great frozen cascade, down which
the ice appears to tumble in wild confusion. Above
the cascade you see an expanse of shining snow, occupying
an area of some square miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_14">§ 14.</a> <i>Ice-cascade and Snows of the Col du Géant.</i></p>

<p>119. Instead of climbing to the height where we now
stand, we might have continued our walk upon the Mer
de Glace, turned round the promontory of Trélaporte,
and walked right up the Glacier du Géant. We should
have found ice under our feet up to the bottom of the
cascade. It is not so compact as the ice lower down,
but you would not think of refusing to call it ice.</p>

<p>120. As we approach the fall, the smooth and unbroken
character of the glacier changes more and more.
We encounter transverse ridges succeeding each other
with augmenting steepness. The ice becomes more
and more fissured and confused. We wind through tortuous
ravines, climb huge ice-mounds, and creep cautiously
along crumbling crests, with crevasses right and left.
The confusion increases until further advance along the
centre of the glacier is impossible.</p>

<p>121. But with the aid of an axe to cut steps in the
steeper ice-walls and slopes we might, by swerving to
either side of the glacier, work our way to the top of
the cascade. If we ascended to the right, we should
have to take care of the ice avalanches which sometimes
thunder down the slopes; if to the left, we should have
to take care of the stones let loose from the Aiguille
Noire. After we had cleared the cascade, we should
have to beware for a time of the crevasses, which for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
some distance above the fall yawn terribly. But by
caution we could get round them, and sometimes cross
them by bridges of snow. Here the skill and knowledge
to be acquired only by long practice come into
play; and here also the use of the Alpine rope suggests
itself. For not only are the 'snow bridges often frail,
but whole crevasses are sometimes covered, the unhappy
traveller being first made aware of their existence by
the snow breaking under his feet. Many lives have thus
been lost, and some quite recently.</p>

<p>122. Once upon the plateau above the ice-fall we
find the surface totally changed. Below the fall we
walked upon ice; here we are upon snow. After a
gentle but long ascent we reach a depression of the
ridge which bounds the snow-field at the top, and now
look over Italy. We stand upon the famous Col du
Géant.</p>

<p>123. They were no idle scamperers on the mountains
that made these wild recesses first known; it was not
the desire for health which now brings some, or the
desire for grandeur and beauty which brings others, or
the wish to be able to say that they have climbed a
mountain or crossed a col, which I fear brings a good
many more; it was a desire for <i>knowledge</i> that brought
the first explorers here, and on this col the celebrated
De Saussure lived for seventeen days, making scientific
observations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_15">§ 15.</a> <i>Questioning the Glaciers.</i></p>

<p>124. I would now ask you to consider for a moment
the facts which such an excursion places in our possession.
The snow through which we have in idea trudged
is the snow of last winter and spring. Had we placed
last August a proper mark upon the surface of the snow,
we should find it this August at a certain depth beneath
the surface. A good deal has been melted by the summer
sun, but a good deal of it remains, and it will continue
until the snows of the coming winter fall and
cover it. This again will be in part preserved till next
August, a good deal of it remaining until it is covered
by the snow of the subsequent winter. We thus arrive
at the certain conclusion that on the plateau of the Col
du Géant <i>the quantity of snow that falls annually exceeds
the quantity melted</i>.</p>

<p>125. Had we come in the month of April or May,
we should have found the glacier below the ice-fall also
covered with snow, which is now entirely cleared away
by the heat of summer. Nay, more, the ice there is
obviously melting, forming running brooks which cut
channels in the ice, and expand here and there into
small blue-green lakes. Hence you conclude with
certainty that below the ice-fall <i>the quantity of frozen
material falling upon the glacier is less than the quantity
melted</i>.</p>

<p>126. And this forces upon us another conclusion:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
between the glacier below the ice-fall and the plateau
above it there must exist a line where the quantity of
snow which falls <i>is exactly equal</i> to the quantity annually
melted. This is the <i>snow-line</i>. On some glaciers it is
quite distinct, and it would be distinct here were the
ice less broken and confused than it actually is.</p>

<p>127. The French term <i>névé</i> is applied to the glacial
region above the snow-line, while the word <i>glacier</i> is
restricted to the ice below it. Thus the snows of the
Col du Géant constitute the névé of the Glacier du
Géant, and in part, the névé of the Mer de Glace.</p>

<p>128. But if every year thus leaves a residue of snow
upon the plateau of the Col du Géant, it necessarily follows
that the plateau must get annually higher, <i>provided
the snow remain upon it</i>. Equally certain is the
conclusion that the whole length of the glacier below
the cascade must sink gradually lower, <i>if the waste of
annual melting be not made good</i>. Supposing two feet
of snow a year to remain upon the Col, this would raise
it to a height far surpassing that of Mont Blanc in
five thousand years. Such accumulation must take place
if the snow remain upon the Col; but the accumulation
does <i>not</i> take place, hence the snow does not remain
on the Col. The question then is, whither does it go?</p>

Meanwhile look at that ice-valley in front of us,
stretching up between Mont Tacul and the Aiguille de
Léchaud, to the base of the great ridge called the Grande
Jorasse. This is called the Glacier de Léchaud. It receives
at its head the snows of the Jorasse and of Mont
Mallet, and joins the Glacier du Géant at the promontory
of the Tacul. The glaciers seem welded together where
they join, but they continue distinct. Between them
you clearly trace a stripe of débris (<i>c</i> on the annexed
sketch-plan); you trace a similar though smaller stripe
(<i>a</i> on the sketch), from the junction of the Glacier
du Géant with the Glacier des Périades at the foot of
the Aiguille Noire, which you also follow along the Mer
de Glace.</p>

<p>130. We also see another glacier, or a portion of it,
to the left, falling apparently in broken fragments
through a narrow gorge (Cascade du Talèfre on the
sketch) and joining the Léchaud, and from their point
of junction also a stripe of débris (<i>d</i>) runs downwards
along the Mer de Glace. Beyond this again we notice
another stripe (<i>e</i>), which seems to begin at the bottom
of the ice-fall, rising as it were from the body of the
glacier. Beyond all of these we can notice the lateral
moraine of the Mer de Glace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>131. These stripes are the <i>medial moraines</i> of the
Mer de Glace. We shall learn more about them immediately.</p>

<p>132. And now, having informed our minds by these
observations, let our eyes wander over the whole glorious
scene, the splintered peaks and the hacked and
jagged crests, the far-stretching snow-fields, the smaller
glaciers which nestle on the heights, the deep blue
heaven and the sailing clouds. Is it not worth some
labour to gain command of such a scene? But the
delight it imparts is heightened by the fact that we
did not come expressly to see it; we came to instruct
ourselves about the glacier, and this high enjoyment is
an incident of our labour. You will find it thus
through life; without honest labour there can be no
deep joy.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_17">§ 17.</a> <i>The Talèfre and the Jardin. Work among the
Crevasses.</i></p>

<p>133. And now let us descend to the Mer de Glace,
for I want to take you across the glacier to that broken
ice-fall the origin of which we have not yet seen. We
aim at the farther side of the glacier, and to reach it
we must cross those dark stripes of débris which we
observed from the heights. Looked at from above, these
moraines seemed flat, but now we find them to be
ridges of stones and rubbish, from twenty to thirty feet
high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>134. We quit the ice at a place called the Couvercle,
and wind round this promontory, ascending all the time.
We squeeze ourselves through the <i>Égralets</i>, a kind of
natural staircase in the rock, and soon afterwards obtain
a full view of the ice-fall, the origin of which we wish
to find. The ice upon the fall is much broken; we
have pinnacles and towers, some erect, some leaning,
and some, if we are fortunate, falling like those upon
the Glacier des Bois; and we have chasms from which
issues a delicate blue light. With the ice-fall to our
right we continue to ascend, until at length we command
a view of a huge glacier basin, almost level, and on the
middle of which stands a solitary island, entirely surrounded
by ice. We stand at the edge of the <i>Glacier du
Talèfre</i>, and connect it with the ice-fall we have passed.
The glacier is bounded by rocky ridges, hacked and torn
at the top into teeth and edges, and buttressed by snow
fluted by the descending stones.</p>

<p>135. We cross the basin to the central island, and
find grass and flowers at the place where we enter upon
it. This is the celebrated <i>Jardin</i>, of which you have
often heard. The upper part of the Jardin is bare rock.
Close at hand is one of the noblest peaks in this portion
of the Alps, the Aiguille Verte. It is between thirteen
and fourteen thousand feet high, and down its sides,
after freshly-fallen snow, avalanches incessantly thunder.
From one of its projections a streak of moraine starts
down the Talèfre; from the Jardin also a similar streak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of moraine issues. Both continue side by side to the
top of the ice-fall, where they are engulphed in the
chasms. But at the bottom of the fall they reappear,
as if newly emerging from the body of the glacier, and
afterwards they continue along the Mer de Glace.</p>

<p>136. Walk with me now alongside the moraine from
the Jardin down towards the ice-fall. For a time our
work is easy, such fissures as appear offering no impediment
to our march. But the crevasses become gradually
wider and wilder, following each other at length so
rapidly as to leave merely walls of ice between them.
Here perfect steadiness of foot is necessary a slip would
be death. We look towards the fall, and observe the
confusion of walls and blocks and chasms below us increasing.
At length prudence and reason cry "Halt!"
We may swerve to the right or to the left, and making
our way along crests of ice, with chasms on both hands,
reach either the right lateral moraine or the left lateral
moraine of the glacier.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_18">§ 18.</a> <i>First Questions regarding Glacier Motion.
Drifting of Bodies buried in a Crevasse.</i></p>

<p>137. But what are these lateral moraines? As you
and I go from day to day along the glaciers, their
origin is gradually made plain. We see at intervals
the stones and rubbish descending from the mountain
sides and arrested by the ice. All along the fringe of
the glacier the stones and rubbish fall, and it soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
becomes evident that we have here the source of the
lateral moraines.</p>

<p>138. But how are the medial moraines to be accounted
for? How does the débris range itself upon the
glacier in stripes some hundreds of yards from its edge,
leaving the space between them and the edge clear of
rubbish? Some have supposed the stones to have rolled
over the glacier from the sides, but the supposition will
not bear examination. Call to mind now our reasoning
regarding the excess of snow which falls above the
snow-line, and our subsequent question, How is the
snow disposed of. Can it be that the entire mass is
moving slowly downwards? If so, the lateral moraines
would be carried along by the ice on which they rest,
and when two branch glaciers unite they would lay
their adjacent lateral moraines together to form a medial
moraine upon the trunk glacier.</p>

<p>139. There is, in fact, no way that we can see of disposing
of the excess of snow above the snow-line; there
is no way of making good the constant waste of the
ice below the snow-line; there is no way of accounting
for the medial moraines of the glacier, but by supposing
that from the highest snow-fields of the Col du Géant,
the Léchaud, and the Talèfre, to the extreme end of the
Glacier des Bois, the whole mass of frozen matter is
moving downwards.</p>

<p>140. If you were older, it would give me pleasure to
take you up Mont Blanc. Starting from Chamouni, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
should first pass through woods and pastures, then up
the steep hill-face with the Glacier des Bossons to our
right, to a rock known as the <i>Pierre Pointue</i>; thence
to a higher rock called the <i>Pierre l'Échelle</i>, because here
a ladder is usually placed to assist in crossing the
chasms of the glacier. At the Pierre l'Échelle we
should strike the ice, and passing under the Aiguille du
Midi, which towers to the left, and which sometimes
sweeps a portion of the track with stone avalanches, we
should cross the Glacier des Bossons; amid heaped-up
mounds and broken towers of ice; up steep slopes; over
chasms so deep that their bottoms are hid in darkness.</p>

<p>141. We reach the rocks of the Grands Mulets,
which form a kind of barren islet in the icy sea; thence
to the higher snow-fields, crossing the <i>Petit Plateau</i>,
which we should find cumbered by blocks of ice.
Looking to the right, we should see whence they came,
for rising here with threatening aspect high above us
are the broken ice-crags<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> of the Dôme du Goûté. The
guides wish to pass this place in silence, and it is just
as well to humour them, however much you may doubt
the competence of the human voice to bring the ice-crags
down. From the Petit Plateau a steep snow-slope
would carry us to the Grand Plateau, and at day-dawn
I know nothing in the whole Alps more grand and
solemn than this place.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Named <i>séracs</i> from their resemblance in shape and colour to an
inferior kind of curdy cheese called by this name at Chamouni.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p></div>

<p>142. One object of our ascent would be now attained;
for here at the head of the Grand Plateau, and
at the foot of the final slope of Mont Blanc, I should
show you a great crevasse, into which three guides were
poured by an avalanche in the year 1820.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 414px;">
<img src="images/page57.png" width="414" height="335" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">CREVASSE ON GRAND PLATEAU.</div>
</div>

<p id="prg_143">143. Is this language correct? A crevasse hardly
to be distinguished from the present one undoubtedly
existed here in 1820. But was it the identical crevasse
now existing? Is the ice riven here to-day the same
as that riven fifty-one years ago? By no means. How
is this proved? By the fact that more than forty years
after their interment, the remains of those three guides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
were found near the end of the Glacier des Bossons, many
miles below the existing crevasse.</p>

<p>144. The same observation proves to demonstration
that it is the ice near the <i>bottom</i> of the higher névé
that becomes the <i>surface-ice</i> of the glacier near its end.
The waste of the surface below the snow-line brings
the deeper portions of the ice more and more to the light
of day.</p>

<p>145. There are numerous obvious indications of the
existence of glacier motion, though it is too slow to
catch the eye at once. The crevasses change within
certain limits from year to year, and sometimes from
month to month; and this could not be if the ice did
not move. Rocks and stones also are observed, which
have been plainly torn from the mountain sides. Blocks
seen to fall from particular points are afterwards
observed lower down. On the moraines rocks are
found of a totally different mineralogical character from
those composing the mountains right and left; and in
all such cases strata of the same character are found
bordering the glacier higher up. Hence the conclusion
that the foreign boulders have been <i>floated</i> down by
the ice. Further, the ends or "snouts" of many glaciers
act like ploughshares on the land in front of
them, overturning with slow but merciless energy
huts and chalets that stand in their way. Facts
like these have been long known to the inhabitants
of the High Alps, who were thus made acquainted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in a vague and general way with the motion of the
glaciers.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_19">§ 19.</a> <i>The Motion of Glaciers. Measurements by Hugi
and Agassiz. Drifting of Huts on the Ice.</i></p>

<p>146. But the growth of knowledge is from vagueness
towards precision, and exact determinations of the rate
of glacier motion were soon desired. With reference to
such measurements one glacier in the Bernese Oberland
will remain forever memorable. From the little town
of Meyringen in Switzerland you proceed up the valley
of Hasli, past the celebrated waterfall of Handeck,
where the river Aar plunges into a chasm more than
200 feet deep. You approach the Grimsel Pass, but
instead of crossing it you turn to the right and follow
the course of the Aar upwards. Like the Rhone
and the Arveiron, you find the Aar issuing from a
glacier.</p>

<p>147. Get upon the ice, or rather upon the deep
moraine shingle which covers the ice, and walk upwards.
It is hard walking, but after some time you get clear
of the rubbish, and on to a wide glacier with a great
medial moraine running along its back. This moraine
is formed by the junction of two branch glaciers, the
Lauteraar and the Finsteraar, which unite at a promontory
called the Abschwung to form the trunk
glacier of the Unteraar.</p>

<p>148. On this great medial moraine in 1827 an intrepid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and enthusiastic Swiss professor, Hugi, of Solothurm
(French Soleure), built a hut with a view to observations
upon the glacier. His hut moved, and he
measured its motion. In the three years&mdash;from 1827
to 1830&mdash;it had moved 330 feet downwards. In 1836
it had moved 2,354 feet; and in 1841 M. Agassiz found
it 4,712 feet below its first position.</p>

<p>149. In 1840, M. Agassiz himself and some bold
companions took shelter under a great overhanging slab
of rock on the same moraine, to which they added side
walls and other means of protection. And because he
and his comrades came from Neufchâtel, the hut was
called long afterwards the "Hôtel des Neuchâtelois."
Two years subsequent to its erection M. Agassiz found
that the "hotel" had moved 486 feet downwards.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_20">§ 20.</a> <i>Precise Measurements of Agassiz and Forbes.
Motion of a Glacier proved to resemble the Motion
of a River.</i></p>

<p>150. We now approach an epoch in the scientific
history of glaciers. Had the first observers been
practically acquainted with the instruments of precision
used in surveying, <i>accurate</i> measurements of the
motion of glaciers would probably have been earlier
executed. We are now on the point of seeing such
instruments introduced almost simultaneously by M.
Agassiz on the glacier of the Unteraar, and by Professor
Forbes on the Mer de Glace. Attempts had been made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
by M. Escher de la Linth to determine the motion of
a series of wooden stakes driven into the Aletsch glacier,
but the melting was so rapid that the stakes soon fell.
To remedy this, M. Agassiz in 1841 undertook the great
labour of carrying boring tools to his "hotel," and piercing
the Unteraar glacier at six different places to a depth
of ten feet, in a straight line across the glacier. Into
the holes six piles were so firmly driven that they remained
in the glacier for a year, and in 1842 the displacements
of all six were determined. They were
found to be 160 feet, 225 feet, 269 feet, 245 feet, 210
feet, and 125 feet, respectively.</p>

<p>151. A great step is here gained. You notice that
the middle numbers are the largest. They correspond
to the central portion of the glacier. Hence, these
measurements conclusively establish, not only the fact
of glacier motion, but that <i>the centre of a glacier, like
that of a river, moves more rapidly than the sides</i>.</p>

<p>152. With the aid of trained engineers M. Agassiz
followed up these measurements in subsequent years.
His researches are recorded in a work entitled "Système
glaciaire," which is accompanied by a very noble Atlas
of the Glacier of the Unteraar, published in 1847.</p>

<p id="prg_153">153. These determinations were made by means of a
theodolite, of which I will give you some notion immediately.
The same instrument was employed the
same year by the late Professor Forbes upon the Mer de
Glace. He established independently the greater central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
motion. He showed, moreover, that it is not necessary
to wait a year, or even a week to determine the motion
of a glacier; with a correctly-adjusted theodolite he
was able to determine the motion of various points of
the Mer de Glace from day to day. He affirmed, and
with truth, that the motion of the glacier might be
determined from hour to hour. We shall prove this
farther on (<a href="#prg_162">162</a>). Professor Forbes also triangulated
the Mer de Glace, and laid down an excellent map of
it. His first observations and his survey are recorded
in a celebrated book published in 1843, and entitled
"Travels in the Alps."</p>

<p>154. These observations were also followed up in
subsequent years, the results being recorded in a series
of detached letters and essays of great interest. These
were subsequently collected in a volume entitled "Occasional
Papers on the Theory of Glaciers," published in
1859. The labours of Agassiz and Forbes are the two
chief sources of our knowledge of glacier phenomena.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_21">§ 21.</a> <i>The Theodolite and its Use. Our own
Measurements.</i></p>

<p>155. My object thus far is attained. I have given
you proofs of glacier motion, and a historic account of
its measurement. And now we must try to add a
little to the knowledge of glaciers by our own labours
on the ice. Resolution must not be wanting at the
commencement of our work, nor steadfast patience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
during its prosecution. Look then at this theodolite;
it consists mainly of a telescope and a graduated circle,
the telescope capable of motion up and down, and the
circle, carrying the telescope along with it, capable of
motion right and left. When desired to make the
motion exceedingly fine and minute, suitable screws,
called tangent screws, are employed. The instrument
is supported by three legs, movable, but firm when properly
planted.</p>

<p>156. Two spirit-levels are fixed at right angles to
each other on the circle just referred to. Practice
enables one to take hold of the legs of the instrument,
and so to fix them that the circle shall be nearly
horizontal. By means of four levelling screws we
render it <i>accurately</i> horizontal. Exactly under the
centre of the instrument is a small hook from which a
plummet is suspended; the point of the bob just
touches a rock on which we make a mark; or if the
earth be soft underneath, we drive a stake into it exactly
under the plummet. By re-suspending the plummet
at any future time we can find to a hairbreadth the position
occupied by the instrument to-day.</p>

<p>157. Look through the telescope; you see it crossed
by two fibres of the finest spider's thread. In actual
work we first direct the telescope across the glacier,
until the intersection of the two fibres accurately
covers some well-defined point of rock or tree at the other
side of the valley. This, our fixed standard, we sketch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
with its surroundings in a note-book, so as to be able
immediately to recognise it on our return to this place.
Imagine a straight line drawn from the centre of the
telescope to this point, and that this line is permitted
to drop straight down upon the glacier, every point of
it falling as a stone would fall; along such a line we
have now to fix a series of stakes.</p>

<p>158. A trained assistant is already upon the glacier.
He erects his staff and stands behind it; the telescope
is lowered without swerving to the right or to the
left; in mathematical language it remains <i>in the same
vertical plane</i>. The crossed fibres of the telescope
probably strike the ice a little away from the staff of
the assistant; by a wave of the arm he moves right or
left; he may move too much, so we wave him back
again. After a trial or two he knows whether he is
near the proper point, and if so makes his motions
small. He soon exactly strikes the point covered by
the intersection of the fibres. A signal is made which
tells him that he is right; he pierces the ice with an
auger and drives in a stake. He then goes forward, and
in precisely the same manner takes up another point.
After one or two stakes have been driven in, the
assistant is able to take up the other points very
rapidly. Any requisite number of stakes may thus be
fixed in a straight line across the glacier.</p>

<p>159. Next morning we measure the motion of all the
stakes. The theodolite is mounted in its former position
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and carefully levelled. The telescope is directed
first upon the standard point at the opposite side of
the valley, being moved by a tangent screw until the
intersection of the spider's threads accurately covers the
point. The telescope is then lowered to the first stake,
beside which our trained assistant is already standing.
He is provided with a staff with feet and inches marked
on it. A glance shows us the stake has moved down.
By our signals the assistant recovers the point from
which we started yesterday, and then determines the
distance from this point to the stake. It is, say,
6 inches; through this distance, therefore, the stake has
moved.</p>

<p>160. We are careful to note the hour and minute at
which each stake is driven in, and the hour and the
minute when its distance from its first position is
measured; this enables us to calculate the accurate
<i>daily motion</i> of the point in question. The distances
through which all the other points have moved are determined
in precisely the same way.</p>

<p>161. Thus we shall proceed to work, first making
clear to our minds what is to be done, and then making
sure that it shall be accurately done. To give our work
reality, I will here record the actual measurements
executed, and the actual thoughts suggested, on the
Mer de Glace in 1857. The only unreality that I
would ask you to allow, is that you and I are supposed
to be making the observations together. The labour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of measuring was undertaken for the most part by Mr.
Hirst.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_22">§ 22.</a> <i>Motion of the Mer de Glace.</i></p>

<p id="prg_162">162. On July 14, then, we find ourselves at the end
of the Glacier des Bois, not far from the source of the
Arveiron. We direct our telescope across the glacier,
and fix the intersection of its spider's threads accurately
upon the edge of a pinnacle of ice. We leave the
instrument untouched, looking through it from hour
to hour. The edge of ice moves slowly, but plainly,
past the fibres, and at the end of three hours we assure
ourselves that the motion has amounted to several
inches. While standing near the vault of the Arveiron,
and talking about going into it, its roof gives way, and
falls with the sound of thunder. It is not, therefore,
without reason that I warned you against entering these
vaults in summer.</p>

<p>163. We ascend to the Montanvert Inn, fix on it as
a residence, and then descend to the lateral moraine of
the glacier a little below the inn. Here we erect our
theodolite, and mark its exact position by a plummet.
We must first make sure that our line is perpendicular,
or nearly so, to the axis or middle line of the glacier.
Our instructed assistant lays down a long staff in the
direction of the axis, assuring himself, by looking up and
down, that it is the true direction. With another staff
in his hand, pointed towards our theodolite, he shifts
his position until the second staff is perpendicular to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
first. Here he gives us a signal. We direct our telescope
upon him, and then gradually raising its end in a
vertical plane we find, and note by sketching, a standard
point at the other side of the glacier. This point known,
and our plummet mark known, we can on any future
day find our line. (To render the measurements more
intelligible, I append on the next page an outline diagram
of the Mer de Glace, and of its tributaries.)</p>

<p>164. Along the line just described ten stakes were set
on July 17, 1857. Their displacements were measured
on the following day. Two of them had fallen, but
here are the distances passed over by the eight remaining
ones in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>165. You have already assured yourself by actual
contact that the body of the glacier is real ice, and you
may have read that glaciers move; but the actual
observation of the motion of a body apparently so rigid
is strangely interesting. And not only does the ice
move bodily, but one part of it moves past another;
the rate of motion augmenting gradually from 12
inches a day at the side to 33 inches a day at a
distance from the side. This quicker movement of the
central ice of glaciers had been already observed by
Agassiz and Forbes; we verify their results, and now
proceed to something new. Crossing the Glacier du
Géant, which occupies more than half the valley, we
find that our line of stakes is not yet at an end. The
10th stake stands on the part of the ice which comes
from the Talèfre.</p>

<p>166. Now the motion of the sides is slow, because of
the friction of the ice against its boundaries; but then
one would think that midway between the boundaries,
where the friction of the sides is least, the motion
ought to be greatest. This is clearly not the case; for
though the 10th stake is nearer than the 9th to the
eastern or <i>Chapeau</i> side of the valley, the 10th stake
surpasses the 9th by 6 inches a day.</p>

<p>167. Here we have something to think of; but before
a natural philosopher can think with comfort he
must be perfectly sure of his facts. The foregoing line
ran across the glacier a little below the Montanvert.
We will run another line across a little way above the
hotel. On July 18 we set out this line, and to multiply
our chances of discovery we place along it 31 stakes. On
the subsequent day five of these were found unfit for
use; but here are the distances passed over by the remaining
six-and-twenty in 24 hours.</p>

<p>168. Look at these numbers. The first broad fact
they reveal is the advance in the rate of motion from
first to last. There are however some irregularities;
from 23 inches at the 17th stake we fall to 21 inches at
the 18th; from 23 inches at the 19th we fall to 21 inches
at the 20th; from 25 inches at the 21st we fall to 22
inches at the 22nd and 23rd; but notwithstanding these
small ups and downs, the general advance of the rate
of motion is manifest. Now there may have been some
slight displacement of the stakes by melting, sufficient
to account for these small deviations from uniformity
in the increase of the motion. But another solution is
also possible. We shall afterwards learn that the glacier
is retarded not only by its sides but by its bed;
that the upper portions of the ice slide over the lower
ones. Now if the bed of the Mer de Glace should have
eminences here and there rising sufficiently near to the
surface to retard the motion of the surface, they might
produce the small irregularities noticed above.</p>

<p>169. We note particularly, while upon the ice, that
the 26th stake, like the 10th stake in our last line, stands
much nearer to the eastern than to the western side
of the glacier; the measurements, therefore, offer a further
proof that the centre of this portion of the glacier
is not the place of swiftest motion.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_23">§ 23.</a> <i>Unequal Motion of the two Sides of the

<p>170. But in neither the first line nor the second were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
we able to push our measurements quite across the
glacier. Why? In attempting to do one thing we are
often taught another, and thus in science, if we are only
steadfast in our work, our very defeats are converted
into means of instruction. We at first planted our
theodolite on the lateral moraine of the Mer de Glace,
expecting to be able to command the glacier from side
to side. But we are now undeceived; the centre of
the glacier proves to be higher than its sides, and from
our last two positions the view of the ice near the
opposite side of the glacier was intercepted by the
elevation at the centre. The mountain slopes, in fact,
are warm in summer, and they melt the ice nearest
to them, thus causing a fall from the centre to the
sides.</p>

<p>171. But yonder on the heights at the other side of
the glacier we see a likely place for our theodolite.
We cross the glacier and plant our instrument in a position
from which we sweep the glacier from side to side.
Our first line was below the Montanvert, our second line
above it; this third line is exactly opposite the Montanvert;
in fact, the mark on which we have fixed the
fibre-cross of the theodolite is a corner of one of the
windows of the little inn. Along this line we fix twelve
stakes on July 20. On the 21st one of them had fallen;
but the velocities of the remaining eleven in 24 hours
were found to be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>172. Both the first stake and the eleventh in this
series stood near the sides of the glacier. On the
eastern side the motion is 20 inches, while on the
western side it is only 9. It rises on the eastern side
from 20 to 34 inches at the 5th stake, which we, standing
upon the glacier, can see to be much nearer to the
eastern than to the western side. <i>The united evidence
of these three lines places the fact beyond doubt, that
opposite the Montanvert, and for some distance above it
and below it, the whole eastern side of the glacier is moving
more quickly than the western side.</i></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_24">§ 24.</a> <i>Suggestion of a new Likeness of Glacier Motion
to River Motion. Conjecture tested.</i></p>

<p>173. Here we have cause for reflection, and facts are
comparatively worthless if they do not provoke this
exercise of the mind. It is because facts of nature are
not isolated but connected, that science, to follow them,
must also form a connected whole. The mind of the
natural philosopher must, as it were, be a web of <i>thought</i>
corresponding in all its fibres with the web of <i>fact</i> in
nature.</p>

<p>174. Let us, then, ascend to a point which commands
a good view of this portion of the Mer de Glace. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
ice-river we see is not straight but curved, and its curvature
is <i>from</i> the Montanvert; that is to say, its convex
side is east, and its concave side is west (look to
the sketch). You have already pondered the fact that
a glacier, <i>in some respects</i>, moves like a river. How
would a river move through a curved channel? This is
known. Were the ice of the Mer de Glace displaced by
water, the point of swiftest motion at the Montanvert
would not be the centre, but a point east of the centre.
Can it be then that this "water-rock," as ice is sometimes
called, acts in this respect also like water?</p>

<p>175. This is a thought suggested on the spot; it may
or it may not be true, but the means of testing it are at
hand. Looking up the glacier, we see that at <i>les Ponts</i>
it also bends, but that there its convex curvature is
towards the western side of the valley (look again to
the sketch). If our surmise be true, the point of
swiftest motion opposite <i>les Ponts</i> ought to lie west of
the axis of the glacier.</p>

<p>176. Let us test this conjecture. On July 25 we fix
in a line across this portion of the glacier seventeen
stakes; every one of them has remained firm, and on
the 26th we find the motion for 24 hours to be as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>177. Inspected by the naked eye alone, the stakes 10
and 11, where the glacier reaches its greatest motion,
are seen to be considerably to the west of the axis of
the glacier. Thus far we have a perfect verification of
the <i>guess</i> which prompted us to make these measurements.
You will here observe that the "guesses" of
science are not the work of chance, but of thoughtful
pondering over antecedent facts. The guess is the "induction"
facts, to be ratified or exploded by
the test of subsequent experiment.</p>

<p>178. And though even now we have exceedingly
strong reason for holding that the point of maximum
velocity obeys the law of liquid motion, the strength of
our conclusion will be doubled if we can show that the
point shifts back to the eastern side of the axis at another
place of flexure. Fortunately such a place exists
opposite Trélaporte. Here the convex curvature of the
valley turns again to the east. Across this portion of
the glacier a line was set out on July 28, and from
measurements on the 31st, the rate of motion per 24
hours was determined.</p>

<p>179. Here, again, the mere estimate of distances by
the eye would show us that the three stakes which moved
fastest, viz. the 9th, 10th, and 11th, were all to the east
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the middle line of the glacier. The demonstration
that the point of swiftest motion wanders to and fro
across the axis, as the flexure of the valley changes, is,
therefore,&mdash;shall I say complete?</p>

<p>180. Not yet. For if surer means are open to us
we must not rest content with estimates by the eye. We
have with us a surveying chain: let us shake it out and
measure these lines, noting the distance of every stake
from the side of the glacier. This is no easy work
among the crevasses, but I confide it confidently to Mr.
Hirst and you. We can afterwards compare a number
of stakes on the eastern side with the same number of
stakes taken at the same distances from the western
side. For example, a pair of stakes, one ten yards from
the eastern side and the other ten yards from the western
side; another pair, one fifty yards from the eastern side
and the other fifty yards from the western side, and
so on, can be compared together. For the sake of easy
reference, let us call the points thus compared in pairs,
<i>equivalent points</i>.</p>

<p>181. There were five pairs of such points upon our
fourth line, D D', and here are their velocities:</p>

<p>In every case here the stake at the western side moved

<p>183. Here the three points on the eastern side move
more rapidly than the equivalent points on the western
side.</p>

<p>184. It is thus proved:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>That opposite the Montanvert the eastern half of
the Mer de Glace moves more rapidly than the western half.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>That opposite</i> les Fonts <i>the western half of the
glacier moves more rapidly than the eastern half.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>That opposite Trélaporte the eastern half of the
glacier again moves more rapidly than the western half.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>That these changes in the place of greatest motion
are determined by the flexures of the valley through
which the Mer de Glace moves.</i></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_25">§ 25.</a> <i>New Law of Glacier Motion.</i></p>

<p>185. Let us express these facts in another way. Supposing
the points of swiftest motion for a very great
number of lines crossing the Mer de Glace to be determined;
the line joining all those points together is what
mathematicians would call the <i>locus</i> of the point of
swiftest motion.</p>

<p>186. At Trélaporte this line would lie east of the
centre; at the <i>Ponts</i> it would lie west of the centre;
hence in passing from Trélaporte to the <i>Ponts</i> it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
cross the centre. But at the Montanvert it would again
lie east of the centre; hence between the <i>Ponts</i> and the
Montanvert the centre must be crossed a second time.
If there were further sinuosities upon the Mer de Glace
there would be further crossings of the axis of the glacier.</p>

<p>187. The points on the axis which mark the transition
from eastern to western bending, and the reverse,
may be called <i>points of contrary flexure</i>.</p>

<p>188. Now what is true of the Mer de Glace is true
of all other glaciers moving through sinuous valleys; so
that the facts established in the Mer de Glace may be
expanded into the following general law of glacier motion:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>When a glacier moves through a sinuous valley, the
locus of the points of maximum motion does not coincide
with the centre of the glacier, but, on the contrary,
always lies on the convex side of the central line. The
locus is therefore a curved line more deeply sinuous than
the valley itself, and crosses the axis of the glacier at
each point of contrary flexure.</i></p>

<p>189. The dotted line on the Outline Plan (<a href="#Page_68">page 68</a>)
represents the locus of the point of maximum motion,
the firm line marking the centre of the glacier.</p>

<p>190. Substituting the word <i>river</i> for <i>glacier</i>, this law
is also true. The motion of the water is ruled by precisely
the same conditions as the motion of the ice.</p>

<p>191. Let us now apply our law to the explanation
of a difficulty. Turning to the careful measurements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
executed by M. Agassiz on the glacier of the Unteraar,
we notice in the discussion of these measurements a section
of the "Système glaciaire" devoted to the "Migrations
of the Centre." It is here shown that the middle
of the Unteraar glacier is not always the point of swiftest
motion. This fact has hitherto remained without explanation;
but a glance at the Unteraar valley, or at the
map of the valley, shows the enigma to be an illustration
of the law which we have just established on the Mer de
Glace.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_26">§ 26.</a> <i>Motion of Axis of Mer de Glace.</i></p>

<p id="prg_192">192. We have now measured the rate of motion of
five different lines across the trunk of the Mer de Glace.
Do they all move alike? No. Like a river, a glacier
at different places moves at different rates. Comparing
together the points of maximum motion of all five lines,
we have this result:</p>

<p>194. So much for the trunk glacier; let us now
investigate the branches, permitting, as we have hitherto
done, reflection on known facts to precede our attempts
to discover unknown ones.</p>

<p>195. As we stood upon our "cleft station," whence
we had so capital a view of the Mer de Glace, we were
struck by the fact that some of the tributaries of the
glacier were wider than the glacier itself. Supposing
water to be substituted for the ice, how do you suppose
it would behave? You would doubtless conclude that
the motion down the broad and slightly-inclined valleys
of the Géant and the Léchaud would be comparatively
slow, but that the water would force itself with increased
rapidity through the "narrows" of Trélaporte. Let us
test this notion as applied to the ice.</p>

<p>196. Planting our theodolite in the shadow of Mont
Tacul, and choosing a suitable point at the opposite side
of the Glacier du Géant, we fix on July 29 a series of
ten stakes across the glacier. The motion of this line
in twenty-four hours was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>199. Here our conjecture is still further verified, the
rate of motion being even less than that of the Glacier
du Géant.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_28">§ 28.</a> <i>Motion of Top and Bottom of Glacier.</i></p>

<p>200. We have here the most ample and varied evidence
that the sides of a glacier, like those of a river,
are retarded by friction against its boundaries. But
the likeness does not end here. The motion of a river
is retarded by the friction against its bed. Two observers,
viz. Prof. Forbes and M. Charles Martins, concur
in showing the same to be the case with a glacier. The
observations of both have been objected to; hence it
is all the more incumbent on us to seek for decisive
evidence.</p>

<p>201. At the Tacul (near the point <i>a</i> upon the sketch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
plan, p. 83) a wall of ice about 150 feet high has already
attracted our attention. Bending round to join the
Léchaud the Glacier du Géant is here drawn away from
the mountain side, and exposes a fine section. We try
to measure it top, bottom, and middle, and are defeated
twice over. We try it a third time and succeed. A
stake is fixed at the summit of the ice-precipice, another
at 4 feet from the bottom, and a third at 35 feet above
the bottom. These lower stakes are fixed at some risk
of boulders falling upon us from above; but by skill
and caution we succeed in measuring the motions of all
three. For 24 hours the motions are:&mdash;</p>

<p>202. The retarding influence of the bed of the glacier
is reduced to demonstration by these measurements.
The bottom does not move with half the velocity of the
surface.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_29">§ 29.</a> <i>Lateral Compression of a Glacier.</i></p>

<p>203. Furnished with the knowledge which these
labours and measurements have given us, let us once
more climb to our station beside the Cleft under the
Aiguille de Charmoz. At our first visit we saw the
medial moraines of the glacier, but we knew nothing
about their cause. We now know that they mark upon
the trunk its tributary glaciers. Cast your eye, then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
first upon the Glacier du Géant; realise its width in
its own valley, and see how much it is narrowed at
Trélaporte. The broad ice-stream of the Léchaud is
still more surprising, being squeezed upon the Mer de
Glace to a narrow white band between its bounding
moraines. The Talèfre undergoes similar compression.
Let us now descend, shake out our chain, measure,
and express in numbers the width of the tributaries,
and the actual amount of compression suffered at Trélaporte.</p>

<p>204. We find the width of the Glacier du Géant to
be 5,155 links, or 1,134 yards.</p>

<p>205. The width of the Glacier de Léchaud we find
to be 3,725 links, or 825 yards.</p>

<p>206. The width of the Talèfre we find to be 2,900
links, or 638 yards.</p>

<p>207. The sum of the widths of the three branch
glaciers is therefore 2,597 yards.</p>

<p>208. At Trélaporte these three branches are forced
through a gorge 893 yards wide, or one-third of their
previous width, at the rate of twenty inches a day.</p>

<p>209. If we limit our view to the Glacier de Léchaud,
the facts are still more astonishing. Previous to its
junction with the Talèfre, this glacier has a width of
825 yards; in passing through the jaws of the granite
vice at Trélaporte, its width is reduced to eighty-eight
yards, or in round numbers to one-tenth of its previous
width. (Look to the sketch on the next page.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>210. Are we to understand by this that the ice of
the Léchaud is squeezed to one-tenth of its former
<i>volume</i>? By no means. It is mainly a change of <i>form</i>,
not of volume, that occurs at Trélaporte. Previous to
its compression, the glacier resembles a plate of ice <i>lying
flat</i> upon its bed. After its compression, it resembles a
plate <i>fixed upon its edge</i>. The squeezing, doubtless, has
deepened the ice.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_30">§ 30.</a> <i>Longitudinal Compression of a Glacier.</i></p>

<p>211. The ice is forced through the gorge at Trélaporte
by a pressure from behind; in fact the Glacier
du Géant, immediately above Trélaporte, represents a
piston or a plug which drives the ice through the
gorge. What effect must this pressure have upon the
plug itself? Reasoning alone renders it probable that
the pressure will shorten the plug; that the lower part
of the Glacier du Géant will to some extent yield to the
pressure from behind.</p>

<p>212. Let us test this notion. About three-quarters
of a mile above the Tacul, and on the mountain slope to
the left as we ascend, we observe a patch of verdure.
Thither we climb; there we plant our theodolite, and
set out across the Glacier du Géant, a line, which we
will call line No. 1 (F F' upon sketch, p. 68).</p>

<p>213. About a quarter of a mile lower down we find
a practicable couloir on the mountain side; we ascend
it, reach a suitable platform, plant our instrument, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
set out a second line, No. 2 (G G' upon sketch). We
must hasten our work here, for along this couloir stones
are discharged from a small glacier which rests upon
the slope of Mont Tacul.</p>

<p>214. Still lower down by another quarter of a mile,
which brings us near the Tacul, we set out a third line,
No. 3 (H H' upon sketch), across the glacier.</p>

<p>215. The daily motion of the centres of these three
lines is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="table">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td class="tdl">Inches</td>
  <td></td>
  <td>Distances asunder</td>

  <td>}<br />}</td>
  <td>545 yards.<br />487&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>216. The first line here moves five inches a day more
than the second; and the second nearly three inches a
day more than the third. The reasoning is therefore
confirmed. The ice-plug, which is in round numbers
one thousand yards long, is shortened by the pressure
exerted on its front at the rate of about eight inches a
day.</p>

<p>217. A river descending the Valley du Géant would
behave in substantially the same fashion. It would have
its motion on approaching Trélaporte diminished, and
it would pour through the defile with a velocity greater
than that of the water behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_31">§ 31.</a> <i>Sliding and Flowing. Hard Ice and Soft Ice.</i></p>

<p>218. We have thus far confined ourselves to the
measurement and discussion of glacier motion; but in
our excursions we have noticed many things besides.
Here and there, where the ice has retreated from the
mountain side, we have seen the rocks fluted, scored,
and polished; thus proving that the ice had slidden over
them and ground them down. At the source of the
Arveiron we noticed the water rushing from beneath
the glacier charged with fine matter. All glacier
rivers are similarly charged. The Rhone carries its
load of matter into the Lake of Geneva; the rush of
the river is here arrested, the matter subsides, and the
Rhone quits the lake clear and blue. The Lake of
Geneva, and many other Swiss lakes, are in part filled
up with this matter, and will, in all probability, finally
be obliterated by it.</p>

<p>219. One portion of the motion of a glacier is due to
this bodily sliding of the mass over its bed.</p>

<p>220. We have seen in our journeys over the glacier
streams formed by the melting of the ice, and escaping
through cracks and <i>crevasses</i> to the bed of the glacier.
The fine matter ground down is thus washed away;
the bed is kept lubricated, and the sliding of the ice rendered
more easy than it would otherwise be.</p>

<p>221. As a skater also you know how much ice is
weakened by a thaw. Before it actually melts it becomes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
rotten and unsafe. Test such ice with your penknife:
you can dig the blade readily into it, or cut the ice with
ease. Try good sound ice in the same way: you find
it much more resistant. The one, indeed, resembles
soft chalk; the other hard stone.</p>

<p>222. Now the Mer de Glace in summer is in this
thawing condition. Its ice is rendered soft and yielding
by the sun; its motion is thereby facilitated. We have
seen that not only does the glacier slide over its bed,
but that the upper layers slide over the under ones, and
that the centre slides past the sides. The softer and
more yielding the ice is, the more free will be this motion,
and the more readily also will it be forced through
a defile like Trélaporte.</p>

<p>223. But in winter the thaw ceases; the quantity of
water reaching the bed of the glacier is diminished or
entirely cut off. The ice also, to a certain depth at
least, is frozen hard. These considerations would justify
the opinion that in winter the glacier, if it moves at
all, must move more slowly than in summer. At all
events, the summer measurements give no clue to the
winter motion.</p>

<p>224. This point merits examination. I will not,
however, ask you to visit the Alps in mid-winter; but, if
you allow me, I will be your deputy to the mountains,
and report to you faithfully the aspect of the region
and the behaviour of the ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_32">§ 32.</a> <i>Winter on the Mer de Glace.</i></p>

<p>225. The winter chosen is an inclement one. There
is snow in London, snow in Paris, snow in Geneva;
snow near Chamouni so deep that the road fences are
entirely effaced. On Christmas night&mdash;nearly at mid-night&mdash;1859,
your deputy reaches Chamouni.</p>

<p>226. The snow fell heavily on December 26; but on
the 27th, during a lull in the storm, we turn out.
There are with me four good guides and a porter. They
tie planks to their feet to prevent them from sinking
in the snow; I neglect this precaution and sink often
to the waist. Four or five times during our ascent
the slope cracks with an explosive sound, and the snow
threatens to come down in avalanches.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> Four years later, viz. in the spring of 1863, a mighty climber and
noble guide and companion of mine, named Johann Joseph Bennen,
was lost, through the cracking and subsequent slipping of snow on
such a slope.</p></div>

<p>The freshly-fallen snow was in that particular condition
which causes its granules to adhere, and hence
every flake falling on the trees had been retained there.
The laden pines presented beautiful and often fantastic
forms.</p>

<p id="prg_227">227. After five hours and a half of arduous work the
Montanvert was attained. We unlocked the forsaken
auberge, round which the snow was reared in buttresses.
I have already spoken of the complex play of crystallising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
forces. The frost figures on the window-panes of
the auberge were wonderful: mimic shrubs and ferns
wrought by the building power while hampered by
the adhesion between the glass and the film in which it
worked. The appearance of the glacier was very impressive;
all sounds were stilled. The cascades which in
summer fill the air with their music were silent, hanging
from the ledges of the rocks in fluted columns of ice.
The surface of the glacier was obviously higher than it
had been in summer; suggesting the thought that while
the winter cold maintained the lower end of the glacier
jammed between its boundaries, the upper portions still
moved downwards and thickened the ice. The peak of
the Aiguille du Dru shook out a cloud-banner, the origin
and nature of which have been already explained
(<a href="#prg_84">84</a>). (See <a href="#Frontispiece"><i>Frontispiece</i></a>.)</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 342px;">

<div class="fig_caption">SNOW-LADEN PINE-TREE.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>228. On the morning of the 28th this banner was
strikingly large and grand, and reddened by the light
of the rising sun, it glowed like a flame. Roses of
cloud also clustered round the crests of the Grande
Jorasse and hung upon the pinnacles of Charmoz.
Four men, well roped together, descended to the glacier.
I had trained one of them in 1857, and he was now to
fix the stakes. The storm had so distributed the snow
as to leave alternate lengths of the glacier bare and
thickly covered. Where much snow lay great caution
was required, for hidden crevasses were underneath.
The men sounded with their staffs at every step. Once
while looking at the party through my telescope the
leader suddenly disappeared; the roof of a crevasse had
given way beneath him; but the other three men
promptly gathered round and lifted him out of the fissure.
The true line was soon picked up by the theodolite;
one by one the stakes were fixed until a series of
eleven of them stood across the glacier.</p>

<p>229. To get higher up the valley was impracticable;
the snow was too deep, and the aspect of the weather
too threatening; so the theodolite was planted amid the
pines a Little way below the Montanvert, whence through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
a vista I could see across the glacier. The men were
wrapped at intervals by whirling snow-wreaths which
quite hid them, and we had to take advantage of the
lulls in the wind. Fitfully it came up the valley, darkening
the air, catching the snow upon the glacier, and
tossing it throughout its entire length into high and
violently agitated clouds, separated from each other by
cloudless spaces corresponding to the naked portions of
the ice. In the midst of this turmoil the men continued
to work. Bravely and steadfastly stake after
stake was set, until at length a series of ten of them
was fixed across the glacier.</p>

<p>230. Many of the stakes were fixed in the snow.
They were four feet in length, and were driven in to a
depth of about three feet. But that night, while listening
to the wild onset of the storm, I thought it possible
that the stakes and the snow which held them
might be carried bodily away before the morning.
The wind, however, lulled. We rose with the dawn, but
the air was thick with descending snow. It was all
composed of those exquisite six-petaled flowers, or six-rayed
stars, which have been already figured and described
(<a href="#sct_9">§ 9</a>). The weather brightening, the theodolite
was planted at the end of the first line. The men
descended, and, trained by their previous experience,
rapidly executed the measurements. The first line was
completed before 11 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> Again the snow began to fall,
filling all the air. Spangles innumerable were showered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
upon the heights. Contrary to expectation, the men
could be seen and directed through the shower.</p>

<p>231. To reach the position occupied by the theodolite
at the end of our second line, I had to wade breast-deep
through snow which seemed as dry and soft as flour.
The toil of the men upon the glacier in breaking through
the snow was prodigious. But they did not flinch, and
after a time the leader stood behind the farthest stake,
and cried, <i>Nous avons fini</i>. I was surprised to hear
him so distinctly, for falling snow had been thought
very deadening to sound. The work was finished, and
I struck my theodolite with a feeling of a general who
had won a small battle.</p>

<p>232. We put the house in order, packed up, and shot
by glissade down the steep slopes of <i>La Filia</i> to the
vault of the Arveiron. We found the river feeble, but
not dried up. Many weeks must have elapsed since any
water had been sent down from the surface of the
glacier. But at the setting in of winter the fissures
were in a great measure charged with water; and the
Arveiron of to-day was probably due to the gradual
<i>drainage</i> of the glacier. There was now no danger of
entering the vault, for the ice seemed as firm as marble.
In the cavern we were bathed by blue light. The
strange beauty of the place suggested magic, and put
me in mind of stories about fairy caves which I had read
when a boy. At the source of the Arveiron our winter
visit to the Mer de Glace ends; next morning your
deputy was on his way to London.</p>

<p>239. The maximum motion here is nineteen inches a
day. Probably the eastern side of the glacier is shallow,
the retardation of the bed making the motion of the
eastern stakes inconsiderable. The width of the glacier
here is 9,030 links, or about a mile and a furlong.
The theodolite was planted high among the rocks on
the western flank of the mountain, about half a mile
above the Märgelin See.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_35">§ 35.</a> <i>Motion of Morteratsch Glacier.</i></p>

<p>240. Far to the east of the Oberland and in that
interesting part of Switzerland known as the Ober Engadin,
stands a noble group of mountains, less in height
than those of the Oberland, but still of commanding
elevation. The group derives its name from its most
dominant peak, the Piz Bernina. To reach the place
we travel by railway from Basel to Zürich, and from
Zürich to Chur (French Coire), whence we pass by diligence
over either the Albula pass or the Julier pass to
the village of Pontresina. Here we are in the immediate
neighbourhood of the Bernina mountains.</p>

<p>241. From Pontresina we may walk or drive along a
good coach road over the Bernina pass into Italy. At
about an hour above the village you would look from
the road into the heart of the mountains, the line of
vision passing through a valley, in which is couched a
glacier of considerable size. Along its back you would
trace a medial moraine, and you could hardly fail to
notice how the moraine, from a mere narrow streak
at first, widens gradually as it descends, until finally it
quite covers the lower end of the glacier. Nor is this
an effect of perspective; for were you to stand upon the
mountain slopes which nourish the glacier, you would
see thence also the widening of the streak of rubbish,
though the perspective here would tend to narrow the
moraine as it retreats downwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>242. The ice-stream here referred to is the Morteratsch
glacier, the end of which is a short hour's walk
from the village of Pontresina. We have now to determine
its rate of motion and to account for the widening
of its medial moraine.</p>

<p>243. In the summer of 1864 Mr. Hirst and myself
set out three lines of stakes across the glacier. The
first line crossed the ice high up; the second a good
distance lower down, and the third lower still. Even
the third line, however, was at a considerable distance
above the actual snout of the glacier. The daily motion
of these three lines was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>246. Here then is a demonstration that the upper
portions of the Morteratsch glacier are advancing on
the lower ones. <i>In 1871 the motion of a point on the
middle of the glacier near its snout was found to be less
than two inches a day!</i></p>

<p>247. What, then, is the consequence of this swifter
march of the upper glacier? Obviously to squeeze this
medial moraine longitudinally, and to cause it to spread
out laterally. We have here distinctly revealed the cause
of the widening of the medial moraine.</p>

<p>248. It has been a question much discussed, whether
a glacier is competent to scoop out or deepen a valley
through which it moves, and this very Morteratsch
glacier has been cited to prove that such is not the case.
Observers went to the snout of the glacier, and finding
it sensibly quiescent, they concluded that no scooping
occurred. But those who contended for the power of
glaciers to excavate valleys never stated, or meant to
state, that it was the snout of the glacier which did
the work. In the Morteratsch glacier the work of excavation,
which certainly goes on to a greater or less extent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
must be far more effectual high up the valley than
at the end of the glacier.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_36">§ 36.</a> <i>Birth of a Crevasse: Reflections.</i></p>

<p>249. Preserving the notion that we are working together,
we will now enter upon a new field of enquiry.
We have wrapped up our chain, and are turning homewards
after a hard day's work upon the Glacier du
Géant, when under our feet, as if coming from the body
of the glacier, an explosion is heard. Somewhat startled,
we look enquiringly over the ice. The sound is repeated,
several shots being fired in quick succession.
They seem sometimes to our right, sometimes to our
left, giving the impression that the glacier is breaking
all round us. Still nothing is to be seen.</p>

<p>250. We closely scan the ice, and after an hour's
strict search we discover the cause of the reports. They
announce the birth of a crevasse. Through a pool upon
the glacier we notice air bubbles ascending, and find the
bottom of the pool crossed by a narrow crack, from
which the bubbles issue. Eight and left from this pool
we trace the young fissure through long distances. It
is sometimes almost too feeble to be seen, and at no
place is it wide enough to admit a knife-blade.</p>

<p>251. It is difficult to believe that the formidable
fissures among which you and I have so often trodden
with awe, could commence in this small way. Such,
however, is the case. The great and gaping chasms on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and above the ice-falls of the Géant and the Talèfre
begin as narrow cracks, which open gradually to
crevasses. We are thus taught in an instructive and
impressive way that appearances suggestive of very
violent action may really be produced by processes so
slow as to require refined observations to detect them.
In the production of natural phenomena two things
always come into play, the <i>intensity</i> of the acting force,
and the <i>time</i> during which it acts. Make the intensity
great, and the time small, and you have sudden
convulsion; but precisely the same apparent effect may
be produced by making the intensity small, and the
time great. This truth is strikingly illustrated by the
Alpine ice-falls and crevasses; and many geological
phenomena, which at first sight suggest violent convulsion,
may be really produced in the selfsame almost
imperceptible way.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_37">§ 37.</a> <i>Icicles.</i></p>

<p>252. The crevasses are grandest on the higher névés,
where they sometimes appear as long yawning fissures,
and sometimes as chasms of irregular outline. A
delicate blue light shimmers from them, but this is
gradually lost in the darkness of their profounder
portions. Over the edges of the chasms, and mostly
over the southern edges, hangs a coping of snow, and
from this depend like stalactites rows of transparent
icicles, 10, 20, 30 feet long. These pendent spears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
constitute one of the most beautiful features of the
higher crevasses.</p>

<p>253. How are they produced? Evidently by the
thawing of the snow. But why, when once thawed,
should the water freeze again to solid spears? You
have seen icicles pendent from a house-eave, which
have been manifestly produced by the thawing of the
snow upon the roof. If we understand these, we shall
also understand the vaster stalactites of the Alpine
crevasses.</p>

<p>254. Gathering up such knowledge as we possess,
and reflecting upon it patiently, let us found upon it, if
we can, a theory of icicles.</p>

<p>255. First, then, you are to know that the <i>air</i> of our
atmosphere is hardly heated at all by the rays of the
sun, whether visible or invisible. The air is highly
transparent to all kinds of rays, and it is only the
scanty fraction to which it is <i>not</i> transparent that expend
their force in warming it.</p>

<p>256. Not so, however, with the snow on which the
sunbeams fall. It absorbs the solar heat, and on a sunny
day you may see the summits of the high Alps glistening
with the water of liquefaction. The <i>air</i> above and
around the mountains may at the same time be many
degrees below the freezing point in temperature.</p>

<p>257. You have only to pass from sunshine into shade
to prove this. A single step suffices to carry you from
a place where the thermometer stands high to one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
where it stands low; the change being due, not to any
difference in the temperature of the <i>air</i>, but simply to
the withdrawal of the thermometer from the direct
action of the solar rays. Nay, without shifting the
thermometer at all, by interposing a suitable screen,
which cuts off the sun's rays, the coldness of the air may
be demonstrated.</p>

<p>258. Look now to the snow upon your house roof.
The sun plays upon it, and melts it; the water trickles
to the eave and then drops down. If the eave face the
sun the water remains water; but if the eave do not
face the sun, the drop, before it quits its parent snow,
<i>is already in shadow</i>. Now the shaded space, as we
have learnt, may be below the freezing temperature. If
so the drop, instead of falling, congeals, and the
rudiment of an icicle is formed. Other drops and
driblets succeed, which trickle over the rudiment, congeal
upon it in part and <i>thicken</i> it at the root. But a
portion of the water reaches the free end of the icicle,
hangs from it, and is there congealed before it escapes.
The icicle is thus <i>lengthened</i>. In the Alps, where the
liquefaction is copious and the cold of the shaded
crevasse intense, the icicles, though produced in the
same way, naturally grow to a greater size. The drainage
of the snow after the sun's power is withdrawn also
produces icicles.</p>

<p>259. It is interesting and important that you should
be able to explain the formation of an icicle; but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
far more important that you should realise the way in
which the various threads of what we call Nature are
woven together. You cannot fully understand an icicle
without first knowing that solar beams powerful enough
to fuse the snows and blister the human skin, nay, it
might be added, powerful enough, when concentrated,
to burn up the human body itself, may pass through
the air, and still leave it at an icy temperature.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_38">§ 38.</a> <i>The Bergschrund.</i></p>

<p>260. Having cleared away this difficulty, let us turn
once more to the crevasses, taking them in the order
of their formation. First then above the névé we have
the final Alpine peaks and crests, against which the
snow is often reared as a steep buttress. We have
already learned that both névés and glaciers are moving
slowly downwards; but it usually happens that the
attachment of the highest portion of the buttress to the
rocks is great enough to enable it to hold on while
the lower portion breaks away. A very characteristic
crevasse is thus formed, called in the German-speaking
portion of the Alps a <i>Bergschrund</i>. It often surrounds
a peak like a fosse, as if to defend it against the assaults
of climbers.</p>

<p>261. Look more closely into its formation. Imagine
the snow as yet unbroken. Its higher portions cling
to the rocks, and move downwards with extreme slowness.
But its lower portions, whether from their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
greater depth and weight, or their less perfect attachment,
are compelled to move more quickly. <i>A pull</i> is
therefore exerted, tending to separate the lower from
the upper snow. For a time this pull is resisted by the
cohesion of the névé; but this at length gives way,
and a crack is formed exactly across the line in which
the pull is exerted. In other words, <i>a crevasse is formed
at right angles to the line of tension</i>.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_39">§ 39.</a> <i>Transverse Crevasses.</i></p>

<p>262. Both on the névé and on the glacier the origin
of the crevasses is the same. Through some cause or
other the ice is thrown into a state of strain, and as it
cannot <i>stretch</i> it <i>breaks</i> across the line of tension. Take
for example, the ice-fall of the Géant, or of the Talèfre,
above which you know the crevasses yawn terribly.
Imagine the névé and the glacier entirely peeled away,
so as to expose the surface over which they move.
From the Col du Géant we should see this surface falling
gently to the place now occupied by the brow of the
cascade. Here the surface would fall steeply down to
the bed of the present Glacier du Géant, where the
slope would become gentle once more.</p>

<p>263. Think of the névé moving over such a surface.
It descends from the Col till it reaches the brow just
referred to. It crosses the brow, and must bend down
to keep upon its bed. Realise clearly what must occur.
The surface of the névé is evidently thrown into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
state of strain; it breaks and forms a crevasse. Each
fresh portion of the névé as it passes the brow is
similarly broken, and thus a succession of crevasses is
sent down the fall. Between every two chasms is a
great transverse ridge. Through local strains upon the
fall those ridges are also frequently broken across,
towers of ice&mdash;<i>séracs</i>&mdash;being the result. Down the fall
both ridges and séracs are borne, the dislocation being
augmented during the descent.</p>

<p>264. What must occur at the foot of the fall? Here
the slope suddenly lessens in steepness. It is plain that
the crevasses must not only cease to open here, but that
they must in whole or in part close up. At the summit
of the fall, the bending was such as to make the surface
convex; at the bottom of the fall the bending renders
the surface concave. In the one case we have <i>strain</i>, in
the other <i>pressure</i>. In the one case, therefore, we have
the <i>opening</i>, and in the other the <i>closing</i> of crevasses.
This reasoning corresponds exactly with the facts of observation.</p>

<p>265. Lay bare your arm and stretch it straight.
Make two ink dots half an inch or an inch apart, exactly
opposite the elbow. Bend your arm, the dots
approach each other, and are finally brought together.
Let the two dots represent the two sides of a crevasse
at the bottom of an ice-fall; the bending of the arm
resembles the bending of the ice, and the closing up of
the dots resembles the closing of the fissures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>266. The same remarks apply to various portions of
the Mer de Glace. At certain places the inclination
changes from a gentler to a steeper slope, and on crossing
the brow between both the glacier breaks its back.
<i>Transverse crevasses</i> are thus formed. There is such a
change of inclination opposite to the Angle, and a still
greater but similar change at the head of the Glacier
des Bois. The consequence is that the Mer de Glace at
the former point is impassable, and at the latter the
rending and dislocation are such as we have seen and
described. Below the Angle, and at the bottom of the
Glacier des Bois, the steepness relaxes, the crevasses heal
up, and the glacier becomes once more continuous
and compact.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_40">§ 40.</a> <i>Marginal Crevasses.</i></p>

<p>267. Supposing, then, that we had no changes of
inclination, should we have no crevasses? We should
certainly have less of them, but they would not wholly
disappear. For other circumstances exist to throw the
ice into a state of strain, and to determine its fracture.
The principal of these is the more rapid movement of
the centre of the glacier.</p>

<p>268. Helped by the labours of an eminent man, now
dead, the late Mr. Wm. Hopkins, of Cambridge, let us
master the explanation of this point together. But the
pleasure of mastering it would be enhanced if we could
see beforehand the perplexing and delusive appearances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
accounted for by the explanation. Could my wishes be
followed out, I would at this point of our researches carry
you off with me to Basel, thence to Thun, thence to
Interlaken, thence to Grindelwald, where you would
find yourself in the actual presence of the Wetterhorn
and the Eiger, with all the greatest peaks of the Bernese
Oberland, the Finsteraarhorn, the Schreckhorn, the
Monch, the Jungfrau, at hand. At Grindelwald, as we
have already learnt, there are two well-known glaciers&mdash;the
Ober Grindelwald and the Unter Grindelwald
glaciers&mdash;on the latter of which our observations should
commence.</p>

<p>269. Dropping down from the village to the bottom
of the valley, we should breast the opposite mountain,
and with the great limestone precipices of the Wetterhorn
to our left, we should get upon a path which commands
a view of the glacier. Here we should see
beautiful examples of the opening of crevasses at the
summit of a brow, and their closing at the bottom.
But the chief point of interest would be the crevasses
formed at the <i>side</i> of this glacier&mdash;the <i>marginal crevasses</i>,
as they may be called.</p>

<p>270. We should find the side copiously fissured, even
at those places where the centre is compact; and we
should particularly notice that the fissures would
neither run in the direction of the glacier, nor straight
across it, but that they would be <i>oblique</i> to it, enclosing
an angle of about 45 degrees with the sides. Starting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
from the side of the glacier the crevasses would be seen
to point <i>upwards</i>; that is to say, the ends of the fissures
abutting against the bounding mountain would appear
to be <i>dragged down</i>. Were you less instructed than
you now are, I might lay a wager that the aspect of
these fissures would cause you to conclude that the
centre of the glacier is left behind by the quicker motion
of the sides.</p>

<p>271. This indeed was the conclusion drawn by M.
Agassiz from this very appearance, before he had
measured the motion of the sides and centre of the glacier
of the Unteraar. Intimately versed with the treatment
of mechanical problems, Mr. Hopkins immediately
deduced the obliquity of the lateral crevasses from the
quicker flow of the centre. Standing beside the glacier
with pencil and note-book in hand, I would at once
make the matter clear to you thus.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/page107.png" width="339" height="152" alt="" />
</div>

<p>272. Let <span class="smcap">A C</span>, in the annexed figure, be one side of
the glacier, and <span class="smcap">B D</span> the other; and let the direction of
motion be that indicated by the arrow. Let <span class="smcap">S T</span> be a
transverse slice of the glacier, taken straight across it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
say to-day. A few days or weeks hence this slice will
have been carried down, and because the centre moves
more quickly than the sides it will not remain straight,
but will bend into the form <span class="smcap">S' T'</span>.</p>

<p>273. Supposing <span class="smcap">T</span> <i>i</i> to be a small square of the
original slice near the side of the glacier. In its new
position the square will be distorted to the lozenge-shaped
figure <span class="smcap">T'</span> <i>i'</i>. Fix your attention upon the diagonal
<span class="smcap">T</span> <i>i</i> of the square; in the lowest position this diagonal,
<i>if the ice could stretch</i>, would be lengthened to <span class="smcap">T'</span> <i>i'</i>.
But the ice does not stretch; it breaks, and we have
a crevasse formed at right angles to <span class="smcap">T'</span> <i>i'</i>. The mere
inspection of the diagram will assure you that the crevasse
will point obliquely <i>upwards</i>.</p>

<p>274. Along the whole side of the glacier the quicker
movement of the centre produces a similar state of
strain; and the consequence is that the sides are
copiously cut by those oblique crevasses, even at places
where the centre is free from them.</p>

<p>275. It is curious to see at other places the transverse
fissures of the centre uniting with those at the sides,
so as to form great curved crevasses which stretch
across the glacier from side to side. The convexity of
the curve is turned <i>upwards</i>, as mechanical principles
declare it ought to be. (See sketch on <a href="#img_109">opposite page</a>.)
But if you were ignorant of those principles, you would
never infer from the aspect of these curves the quicker
motion of the centre. In landslips, and in the motion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of partially indurated mud, you may sometimes notice
appearances similar to those exhibited by the ice.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_41">§ 41.</a> <i>Longitudinal Crevasses.</i></p>

<p>276. We have thus unravelled the origin of both
transverse and marginal crevasses. But where a glacier
issues from a steep and narrow defile upon a comparatively
level plain which allows it room to expand laterally,
its motion is in part arrested, and the level portion
has to bear the thrust of the steeper portions behind.
Here the line of thrust is in the direction of the glacier,
while the direction at right angles to this is one of tension.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Across this latter the glacier breaks, and <i>longitudinal
crevasses</i> are formed.</p>

<p>277. Examples of this kind of crevasse are furnished
by the lower part of the Glacier of the Rhone, when
looked down upon from the Grimsel Pass, or from any
commanding point on the flanking mountains.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_42">§ 42.</a> <i>Crevasses in relation to Curvature of Glacier.</i></p>

<p>278. One point in addition remains to be discussed,
and your present knowledge will enable you to master
it in a moment. You remember at an early period of
OUT researches that we crossed the Mer de Glace from
the Chapeau side to the Montanvert side. I then
desired you to notice that the Chapeau side of the glacier
was more fissured than either the centre or the
Montanvert side (<a href="#prg_75">75</a>). Why should this be so? Knowing
as we now do that the Chapeau side of the glacier
moves more quickly than the other; that the point of
maximum motion does not lie on the centre but far east
of it, we are prepared to answer this question in a perfectly
satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>279. Let <span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">C D</span>, in the diagram opposite, represent
the two curved sides of the Mer de Glace at the
Montanvert, and let <i>m n</i> be a straight line across the
glacier. Let <i>o</i> be the point of maximum motion. The
mechanical state of the two sides of the glacier may
be thus made plain. Supposing the line <i>m n</i> to be a
straight elastic string with its ends fixed; let it be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
grasped firmly at the point o by the finger and thumb,
and drawn to <i>o'</i>, keeping the distance between <i>o'</i> and
the side <span class="smcap">C D</span> constant. Here the length, <i>n o</i> of the string
would have stretched to <i>n o'</i>, and the length <i>m o</i> to <i>m o'</i>
and you see plainly that the stretching of the short line,
in comparison with its length, is greater than that of
the long line in comparison with its length. In other
words, the strain upon <i>n o'</i> is greater than that upon
<i>m o'</i>; so that if one of them were to break under the
strain, it would be the short one.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 270px;">
<img src="images/page111.png" width="270" height="147" alt="Montanvert" />
</div>

<p>280. These two lines represent the conditions of
strain upon the two sides of the glacier. The sides are
held back, and the centre tries to move on, a strain being
thus set up between the centre and sides. But the
displacement of the point of maximum motion through
the curvature of the valley makes the strain upon the
eastern ice greater than that upon the western. The
eastern side of the glacier is therefore more crevassed
than the western.</p>

<p>281. Here indeed resides the difficulty of getting
along the eastern side of the Mer de Glace: a difficulty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
which was one reason for our crossing the glacier
opposite to the Montanvert. There are two convex
sweeps on the eastern side to one on the western side,
hence on the whole the eastern side of the Mer de Glace
is most riven.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_43">§ 43.</a> <i>Moraine-ridges, Glacier Tables, and Sand-Cones.</i></p>

<p>282. When you and I first crossed the Mer de Glace
from Trélaporte to the Couvercle, we found that the
stripes of rocks and rubbish which constituted the
medial moraines were ridges raised above the general
level of the glacier to a height at some places of twenty
or thirty feet. On examining these ridges we found the
rubbish to be superficial, and that it rested upon a great
spine of ice which ran along the back of the glacier.
By what means has this ridge of ice been raised?</p>

<p>283. Most boys have read the story of Dr. Franklin's
placing bits of cloth of various colours upon snow on
a sunny day. The bits of cloth sank in the snow, the
dark ones most.</p>

<p>284. Consider this experiment. The sun's rays first
of all fall upon the upper surface of the cloth and warm
it. The heat is then conducted through the cloth to
the under surface, and the under surface passes it on to
the snow, which is finally liquefied by the heat. It is
quite manifest that the quantity of snow melted will
altogether depend upon the amount of heat sent from
the upper to the under surface of the cloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>285. Now cloth is what is called a bad conductor.
It does not permit heat to travel freely through it.
But where it has merely to pass through the thickness
of a single bit of cloth, a good quantity of the heat gets
through. But if you double or treble or quintuple the
thickness of the cloth; or, what is easier, if you put
several pieces one upon the other, you come at length
to a point where no sensible amount of heat could get
through from the upper to the under surface.</p>

<p>286. What must occur if such a thick piece, or such
a series of pieces of cloth, were placed upon snow on
which a strong sun is falling? The snow round the
cloth is melted, but that underneath the cloth is protected.
If the action continue long enough the inevitable
result will be, that the level of the snow all round
the cloth will sink, and the cloth will be left behind
perched upon an eminence of snow.</p>

<p>287. If you understand this, you have already mastered
the cause of the moraine-ridges. They are not produced
by any swelling of the ice upwards. But the ice
underneath the rocks and rubbish being protected from
the sun, the glacier right and left melts away and leaves
a ridge behind.</p>

<p>288. Various other appearances upon the glacier are
accounted for in the same way. Here upon the Mer de
Glace we have flat slabs of rock sometimes lifted up on
pillars of ice. These are the so-called <i>Glacier Tables</i>.
They are produced, not by the growth of a stalk of ice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
out of the glacier, but by the melting of the glacier all
round the ice protected by the stone. Here is a sketch
of one of the Tables of the Mer de Glace.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 329px;">
<img src="images/page114.png" width="329" height="307" alt="" />
</div>

<p>289. Notice moreover that a glacier table is hardly
ever set square upon its pillar. It generally leans to
one side, and repeated observation teaches you that it so
leans as to enable you always to draw the north and
south line upon the glacier. For the sun being south
of the zenith at noon pours its rays against the southern
end of the table, while the northern end remains in
shadow. The southern end, therefore, being most
warmed does not protect the ice underneath it so effectually
as the northern end. The table becomes inclined,
and ends by sliding bodily off its pedestal.</p>

<p>290. In the figure opposite we have what maybe called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
an ideal Table. The oblique lines represent the direction
of the sunbeams, and the consequent tilting of the table
here shown resembles that observed upon the glaciers.</p>

<p>291. A pebble will not rise thus: like Franklin's
single bit of cloth, a dark-coloured pebble sinks in the
ice. A spot of black mould will not rest upon the surface,
but will sink; and various parts of the Glacier du
Géant are honeycombed by the sinking of such spots of
dirt into the ice.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 309px;">
<img src="images/page115.png" width="309" height="301" alt="" />
</div>

<p>292. But when the dirt is of a thickness sufficient
to protect the ice the case is different. Sand is often
washed away by a stream from the mountains, or from
the moraines, and strewn over certain spaces of the
glacier. A most curious action follows: the sanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
surface rises, the part on which the sand lies thickest
rising highest. Little peaks and eminences jut forth,
and when the distribution of the sand is favourable,
and the action sufficiently prolonged, you have little
mountains formed, sometimes singly, and sometimes
grouped so as to mimic the Alps themselves. The <i>Sand-Cones</i>
of the Mer de Glace are not striking; but on
the Görner, the Aletsch, the Morteratsch, and other glaciers,
they form singly and in groups, reaching sometimes
a height of ten or twenty feet.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_44">§ 44.</a> <i>The Glacier Mills or Moulins.</i></p>

<p>293. You and I have learned by long experience the
character of the Mer de Glace. We have marched over
it daily, with a definite object in view, but we have
not closed our eyes to other objects. It is from side
glimpses of things which are not at the moment occupying
our attention that fresh subjects of enquiry arise
in scientific investigation.</p>

<p>294. Thus in marching over the ice near Trélaporte
we were often struck by a sound resembling low rumbling
thunder. We subsequently sought out the origin
of this sound, and found it.</p>

<p>295. A large area of this portion of the glacier is
unbroken. Driblets of water have room to form rills;
rills to unite and form streams; streams to combine to
form rushing brooks, which sometimes cut deep channels
in the ice. Sooner or later these streams reach a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
strained portion of the glacier, where a crack is formed
across the stream. A way is thus opened for the water
to the bottom of the glacier. By long action the stream
hollows out a shaft, the crack thus becoming the
starting-point of a funnel of unseen depth, into which
the water leaps with the sound of thunder.</p>

<p>296. This funnel and its cataract form a glacier Mill
or <i>Moulin</i>.</p>

<p>297. Let me grasp your hand firmly while you stand
upon the edge of this shaft and look into it. The hole,
with its pure blue shimmer, is beautiful, but it is terrible.
Incautious persons have fallen into these shafts, a second
or two of bewilderment being followed by sudden
death. But caution upon the glaciers and mountains
ought, by habit, to be made a second nature to explorers
like you and me.</p>

<p>298. The crack into which the stream first descended
to form the moulin, moves down with the glacier. A
succeeding portion of the ice reaches the place where
the breaking strain is exerted. A new crack is then
formed above the moulin, which is thenceforth forsaken
by the stream, and moves downward as an empty
shaft. Here upon the Mer de Glace, in advance of the
<i>Grand Moulin</i>, we see no less than six of these forsaken
holes. Some of them we sound to a depth of 90 feet.</p>

<p>299. But you and I both wish to determine, if possible,
the entire depth of the Mer de Glace. The Grand
Moulin offers a chance of doing this which we must not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
neglect. Our first effort to sound the moulin fails
through the breaking of our cord by the impetuous
plunge of the water. A lump of grease in the hollow
of a weight enables a mariner to judge of a sea bottom.
We employ such a weight, but cannot reach the bed of
the glacier. A depth of 163 feet is the utmost reached
by our plummet.</p>

<p>300. From July 28 to August 8 we have watched
the progress of the Grand Moulin. On the former date
the position of the Moulin was fixed. On the 31st it
had moved down 50 inches; a little more than a day
afterwards it had moved 74 inches. On August 8 it
had moved 198 inches, which gives an average of about
18 inches in twenty-four hours. No doubt next summer
upon the Mer de Glace a Grand Moulin will be found
thundering near Trélaporte; but like the crevasse of the
Grand Plateau, already referred to (<a href="#sct_16">§ 16</a>), it will not
be our Moulin. This, or rather the ice which it penetrated,
is now probably more than a mile lower down
than it was in 1857.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_45">§ 45.</a> <i>The Changes of Volume of Water by Heat and Cold.</i></p>

<p>301. We have noticed upon the glacier shafts and
pits filled with water of the most delicate blue. In
some cases these have been the shafts of extinct moulins
closed at the bottom. A theory has been advanced
to account for them, which, though it may
be untenable, opens out considerations regarding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
properties of water that ought to be familiar to enquirers
like you and me.</p>

<p>302. In our dissection of lake ice by a beam of heat
(<a href="#sct_11">§ 11</a>) we noticed little vacuous spots at the centres of
the liquid flowers formed by the beam. These spots we
referred to the fact that when ice is melted the water
produced is less in volume than the ice, and that hence
the water of the flower was not able to occupy the whole
space covered by the flower.</p>

<p>303. Let us more fully illustrate this subject. Stop
a small flask water-tight with a cork, and through the
cork introduce a narrow glass tube also water-tight. It
is easy to fill the flask with water so that the liquid shall
stand at a certain height in the glass tube.</p>

<p>304. Let us now warm the flask with the flame of
a spirit-lamp. On first applying the flame you notice
a momentary sinking of the liquid in the glass tube.
This is due to the momentary expansion of the flask by
heat; it becomes suddenly larger when the flame is first
applied.</p>

<p>305. But the expansion of the water soon overtakes
that of the flask and surpasses it. We immediately see
the rise of the liquid column in the glass tube, exactly
as mercury rises in the tube of a warmed thermometer.</p>

<p>306. Our glass tube is ten inches long, and at starting
the water stood in it at a height of five inches.
We will apply the spirit-lamp flame until the water rises
quite to the top of the tube and trickles over. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
experiment suffices to show the expansion of the water
by heat.</p>

<p>307. We now take a common finger-glass and put
into it a little pounded ice and salt. On this we place
the flask, and then build round it the freezing mixture.
The liquid column retreats down the tube, proving the
contraction of the liquid by cold. We allow the shrinking
to continue for some minutes, noticing that the
downward retreat of the liquid becomes gradually slower,
and that it finally ceases altogether.</p>

<p>308. Keep your eye upon the liquid column; it remains
quiescent for a fraction of a minute, and then
moves once more. But its motion is now <i>upwards</i>
instead of downwards. <i>The freezing mixture now acts
exactly like the flame.</i></p>

<p>309. It would not be difficult to pass a thermometer
through the cork into the flask, and it would tell us the
exact temperature at which the liquid ceased to contract
and began to expand. At that moment we should find
the temperature of the liquid a shade over 39° Fahr.</p>

<p>310. At this temperature, then, water attains <i>its
maximum density</i>.</p>

<p>311. Seven degrees below this temperature, or at 32°
Fahr., the liquid begins to turn into solid crystals of ice,
which you know swims upon water because it is bulkier
for a given weight. In fact, this halt of the approaching
molecules at the temperature of 39°, is but the preparation
for the subsequent act of crystallisation, in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the expansion by cold culminates. Up to the point of
solidification the increase of volume is slow and gradual;
while in the act of solidification it is sudden, and of
overwhelming strength.</p>

<p id="prg_312">312. By this force of expansion the Florentine Academicians
long ago burst a sphere of copper nearly three
quarters of an inch in thickness. By the same force
the celebrated astronomer Huyghens burst in 1667 iron
cannons a finger breadth thick. Such experiments
have been frequently made since. Major Williams
during a severe Quebec winter filled a mortar with
water, and closed it by driving into its muzzle a plug
of wood. Exposed to a temperature 50° Fahr. below
the freezing point of water, the metal resisted the
strain, but the plug gave way, being projected to a distance
of 400 feet. At Warsaw howitzer shells have been
thus exploded; and you and I have shivered thick bombshells
to fragments, by placing them for half an hour
in a freezing mixture.</p>

<p>313. The theory of the shafts and pits referred to
at the beginning of this section is this: The water
at the surface of the shaft is warmed by the sun, say to
a temperature of 39° Fahr. The water at the bottom,
in contact with the ice, must be at 32° or near it. The
heavier water is therefore at the top; it will descend
to the bottom, melt the ice there, and thus deepen the
shaft.</p>

<p>314. The circulation here referred to undoubtedly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
goes on, and some curious effects are due to it; but
not, I think, the one here ascribed to it. The <i>deepening</i>
of a shaft implies a quicker melting of its bottom than
of the surface of the glacier. It is not easy to see how
the fact of the solar heat being first absorbed by water,
and then conveyed by it to the bottom of the shaft,
should make the melting of the bottom more rapid than
that of the ice which receives the direct impact of
the solar rays. The surface of the glacier must sink
<i>at least</i> as rapidly as the bottom of the pit, so that the
circulation, though actually existing, cannot produce the
effect ascribed to it.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_46">§ 46.</a> <i>Consequences flowing from the foregoing Properties
of Water. Correction of Errors.</i></p>

<p>315. I was not much above your age when the property
of water ceasing to contract by cold at a temperature
of 39° Fahr. was made known to me, and I still
remember the impression it made upon me. For I was
asked to consider what would occur in case this solitary
exception to an otherwise universal law ceased
to exist.</p>

<p>316. I was asked to reflect upon the condition of a
lake stored with fish and offering its surface to very
cold air. It was made clear to me that the water on
being first chilled would shrink in volume and become
heavier, that it would therefore sink and have its place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
supplied by the warmer and lighter water from the
deeper portions of the lake.</p>

<p>317. It was pointed out to me that without the law
referred to this process of circulation would go on until
the whole water of the lake had been lowered to the
freezing temperature. Congelation would then begin,
and would continue as long as any water remained to be
solidified. One consequence of this would be to destroy
every living thing contained in the lake. Other calamities
were added, all of which were said to be prevented by
the perfectly exceptional arrangement, that after a certain
time the <i>colder</i> water becomes the <i>lighter</i>, floats
on the surface of the lake, is there congealed, thus throwing
a protecting roof over the life below.</p>

<p>318. Count Rumford, one of the most solid of scientific
men, writes in the following strain about this question:&mdash;"It
does not appear to me that there is anything
which human sagacity can fathom, within the wide-extended
bounds of the visible creation, which affords a
more striking or more palpable proof of the wisdom of
the Creator, and of the special care He has taken in the
general arrangement of the universe, to preserve animal
life, than this wonderful contrivance.</p>

<p>319. "Let me beg the attention of my readers while
I endeavour to investigate this most interesting subject;
and let me at the same time bespeak his candour and
indulgence. I feel the danger to which a mortal exposes
himself who has the temerity to explain the designs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of Infinite Wisdom. The enterprise is adventurous, but
it surely cannot be improper.</p>

<p>320. "Had not Providence interfered on this occasion
in a manner which may well be considered as <i>miraculous</i>,
all the fresh water within the polar circle must
inevitably have been frozen to a very great depth in
winter, and every plant and tree destroyed."</p>

<p>321. Through many pages of his book Count Rumford
continues in this strain to expound the ways and
intentions of the Almighty, and he does not hesitate to
apply very harsh words to those who cannot share his
notions. He calls them hardened and degraded. We
are here warned of the fact, which is too often forgotten,
that the pleasure or comfort of a belief, or the
warmth or exaltation of feeling which it produces, is no
guarantee of its truth. For the whole of Count Rumford's
delight and enthusiasm in connexion with this
subject, and the whole of his ire against those who did
not share his opinions, were founded upon an erroneous
notion.</p>

<p>322. Water is <i>not</i> a solitary exception to an otherwise
general law. There are other molecules than those of
this liquid which require more room in the solid crystalline
condition than in the adjacent molten condition.
Iron is a case in point. Solid iron floats upon molten
iron exactly as ice floats upon water. Bismuth is a still
more impressive case, and we could shiver a bomb as
certainly by the solidification of bismuth as by that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
water. There is no fish, to be taken care of here, still
the "contrivance" is the same.</p>

<p>323. I am reluctant to mention them in the same
breath with Count Rumford, but I am told that in our
own day there are people who profess to find the comforts
of a religion in a superstition lower than any that has
hitherto degraded the civilized human mind. So that
the <i>happiness</i> of a faith and the <i>truth</i> of a faith are two
totally different things.</p>

<p>324. Life and the conditions of life are in necessary
harmony. This is a truism, for without the suitable
conditions life could not exist. But both life and its
conditions set forth the operations of inscrutable Power.
We know not its origin; we know not its end. And
the presumption, if not the degradation, rests with those
who place upon the throne of the universe a magnified
image of themselves, and make its doings a mere colossal
imitation of their own.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_47">§ 47.</a> <i>The Molecular Mechanism of Water-Congelation.</i></p>

<p>325. But let us return to our science. How are we
to picture this act of expansion on the part of freezing
water? By what operation do the molecules demand
with such irresistible emphasis more room in the solid
than in the adjacent liquid condition? In all cases of
this kind we must derive our conceptions from the
world of the senses, and transfer them afterwards to a
world transcending the range of the senses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>326. You have not forgotten our conversation regarding
"atomic poles" (<a href="#sct_10">§ 10</a>), and how the notion
of polar force came to be applied to crystals. With
this fresh in your memory, you will have no great difficulty
in understanding how expansion of volume may
accompany the act of crystallisation.</p>

<p>327. I place a number of magnets before you. They,
as matter, are affected by gravity, and, if perfectly free,
they would move towards each other in obedience to
the attraction of gravity.</p>

<p>328. But they are not only matter, but <i>magnetic</i>
matter. They not only act upon each other by the
simple force of gravity, but by the polar force of
magnetism. Imagine them placed at a distance from
each other, and perfectly free to move. Gravity first
makes itself felt and draws them together. For a time
the magnetic force issuing from the poles is insensible;
but when a certain nearness is attained, the polar force
comes into play. The mutually attracting points close
up, the mutually repellent points retreat, and it is easy
to see that this action may produce an arrangement of
the magnets which requires more room. Suppose them
surrounded by a box which exactly encloses them at
the moment the polar force first comes into play. It
is easy to see that in arranging themselves subsequently
the repelled corners and ends of the magnets may be
caused to press against the sides of the box, and even
to burst it, if the forces be sufficiently strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>329. Here then we have a conception which may
be applied to the molecules of water. They, like the
magnets, are acted upon by two distinct forces. For a
time while the liquid is being cooled they approach
each other, in obedience to their general attraction for
each other. But at a certain point new forces, some
attractive, some repulsive, <i>emanating from special points</i>
of the molecules, come into play. The attracted points
close up, the repelled points retreat. Thus the molecules
turn and rearrange themselves, demanding, as
they do so, more space, and overcoming all ordinary
resistance by the energy of their demand. This, in
general terms, is an explanation of the expansion of
water in solidifying: it would be easy to construct an
apparatus for its illustration.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_48">§ 48.</a> <i>The Dirt Bands of the Mer de Glace.</i></p>

<p>330. Pass from bright sunshine into a moderately
lighted room; for a time all appears so dark that the
objects in the room are not to be clearly distinguished.
Hit violently by the waves of light (<a href="#sct_3">§ 3</a>) the optic nerve
is numbed, and requires time to recover its sensitiveness.</p>

<p>331. It is for this reason that I choose the present
hour for a special observation on the Mer de Glace.
The sun has sunk behind the ridge of Charmoz, and the
surface of the glacier is in sober shade. The main
portion of our day's work is finished, but we have still
sufficient energy to climb the slopes adjacent to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Montanvert to a height of a thousand feet or thereabouts
above the ice.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/page128.png" width="336" height="543" alt="" />
</div>

<p>332. We now look fairly down upon the glacier, and
see it less foreshortened than from the Montanvert. We
notice the diet overspreading its eastern side, due to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the crowding together of its medial moraines. We see
the comparatively clean surface of the Glacier du
Géant; but we notice upon this surface an appearance
which we have not hitherto seen. It is crossed by
a series of grey bent bands, which follow each other in
succession, from Trélaporte downwards. We count
eighteen of these from our present position. (See sketch,
<a href="#Page_128">page 128</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>333. These are the <i>Dirt Bands</i> of the Mer de Glace;
they were first observed by Professor Forbes in 1842.</p>

<div id="img_130" class="fig_center" style="width: 519px;">
<img src="images/page130.png" width="519" height="515" alt="" />
</div>

<p>334. They extend down the glacier further than we
can see; and if we cross the valley of Chamouni, and
climb the mountains at the opposite side, to a point
near the little auberge, called La Flégère, we shall command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a view of the end of the glacier and observe the
completion of the series of bands. We notice that they
are confined throughout to the portion of the glacier
derived from the Col du Géant. (See sketch, <a href="#Page_129">page 129</a>.)</p>

<p>335. We must trace them to their source. You
know how noble and complete a view is obtained of the
glacier and Col du Géant from the Cleft Station above
Trélaporte. Thither we must once more climb; and
thence we can see the succession of bands stretching
downwards to the Montanvert, and upwards to the base
of the ice-cascade upon the Glacier du Géant. The
cascade is evidently concerned in their formation. (See
sketch <a href="#img_130">opposite</a>.)</p>

<p>336. And how? Simply enough. The glacier, as
we know, is broken transversely at the summit of the
ice-fall, and descends the declivity in a series of great
transverse ridges. At the base of the fall, the chasms
are closed, but the ridges in part remain forming
protuberances, which run like vast wrinkles across
the glacier. These protuberances are more and more
bent because of the quicker motion of the centre, and
the depressions between them form receptacles for the
fine mud and débris washed by the little rills from the
adjacent slopes.</p>

<p>337. The protuberances sink gradually through the
wasting action of the sun, so that long before Trélaporte
is reached they have wholly disappeared. Not so the
dirt of which they were the collectors: it continues to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
occupy, in transverse bands, the flat surface of the glacier.
At Trélaporte, moreover, where the valley becomes
narrow, the bands are much sharpened, obtaining there
the character which they afterwards preserve throughout
the Mer de Glace. Other glaciers with cascades
also exhibit similar bands.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_49">§ 49.</a> <i>Sea Ice and Icebergs.</i></p>

<p>338. We are now equipped intellectually for a campaign
into another territory. Water becomes heavier
and more difficult to freeze when salt is dissolved in it.
Sea water is therefore heavier than fresh, and the
Greenland Ocean requires to freeze it a temperature
3½ degrees lower than fresh water. When concentrated
till its specific gravity reaches 1.1045, sea water requires
for its congelation a temperature 18&#8531; degrees lower than
the ordinary freezing-point.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> Scoresby.</p></div>

<p>339. But even when the water is saturated with salt,
the crystallising force studiously rejects the salt, and
devotes itself to the congelation of the water alone.
Hence the ice of sea water, when melted, produces fresh
water. The only saline particles existing in such ice
are those entangled 'mechanically in its pores. They
have no part or lot in the structure of the crystal.</p>

<p>340. This <i>exclusiveness</i>, if I may use the term, of
the water molecules; this entire rejection of all foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
elements from the edifices which they build, is enforced
to a surprising degree. Sulphuric acid has so strong
an affinity for water that it is one of the most powerful
agents known to the chemist for the removal of humidity
from air. Still, as shown by Faraday, when a mixture
of sulphuric acid and water is frozen, the crystal
formed is perfectly sweet and free from acidity. The
water alone has lent itself to the crystallising force.</p>

<p>341. Every winter in the Arctic regions the sea
freezes, roofing itself with ice of enormous thickness
and vast extent. By the summer heat, and the tossing
of the waves, this is broken up; the fragments are
drifted by winds and borne by currents. They clash,
they crush each other, they pile themselves into heaps,
thus constituting the chief danger encountered by mariners
in the polar seas.</p>

<p>342. But among the drifting masses of flat sea-ice,
vaster masses sail, which spring from a totally different
source. These are the <i>Icebergs</i> of the Arctic seas. They
rise sometimes to an elevation of hundreds of feet above
the water, while the weight of ice submerged is about
seven times that seen above.</p>

<p>343. The first observers of striking natural phenomena
generally allow wonder and imagination more
than their due place. But to exclude all error arising
from this cause, I will refer to the journal of a cool and
intrepid Arctic navigator, Sir Leopold McClintock. He
describes an iceberg 250 feet high, which was aground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in 500 feet of water. This would make the entire
height of the berg 750 feet, not an unusual altitude for
the greater icebergs.</p>

<p>344. From Baffin's Bay these mighty masses come
sailing down through Davis' Straits into the broad Atlantic.
A vast amount of heat is demanded for the
simple liquefaction of ice (<a href="#sct_48">§ 48</a>); and the melting of
icebergs is on this account so slow, that when large
they sometimes maintain themselves till they have been
drifted 2000 miles from their place of birth.</p>

<p>345. What is their origin? The Arctic glaciers.
From the mountains in the interior the indurated snows
slide into the valleys and fill them with ice. The
glaciers thus formed move like the Swiss ones, incessantly
downward. But the Arctic glaciers reach the
sea, enter it, often ploughing up its bottom into submarine
moraines. Undermined by the lapping of the
waves, and unable to resist the strain imposed by their
own weight, they break across, and discharge vast
masses into the ocean. Some of these run aground on
the adjacent shores, and often maintain themselves for
years. Others escape southward, to be finally dissolved
in the warm waters of the Atlantic. The first engraving
on the opposite page is copied from a photograph
taken by Mr. Bradford during a recent expedition to the
Northern seas. The second represents a mass of ice
upon the Glacier des Bossons. Their likeness suggests
their common origin.</p>

<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_50">§ 50.</a> <i>The Æggischhorn, the Märgelin See and its
Icebergs.</i></p>

<p>346. I am, however, unwilling that you should quit
Switzerland without seeing such icebergs as it can show,
and indeed there are other still nobler glaciers than the
Mer de Glace with which you ought to be acquainted.
In tracing the Rhone to its source, you have already
ascended the valley of the Rhone. Let us visit it again
together; halt at the little town of Viesch, and go from
it straight up to the excellent hostelry on the slope of
the Æggischhorn. This we shall make our head-quarters
while we explore that monarch of European ice-streams,&mdash;the
great Aletsch glacier.</p>

<p>347. Including the longest of its branches, this noble
ice-river is about twenty miles long, while at the middle
of its trunk it measures nearly a mile and a quarter from
side to side. The grandest mountains of the Bernese
Oberland, the Jungfrau, the Monch, the Trugberg, the
Aletschhorn, the Breithorn, the Gletscherhorn, and
many another noble peak and ridge, are the collectors
of its névés. From three great valleys formed in the
heart of the mountains these névés are poured, uniting
together to form the trunk of the Aletsch at a place
named by a witty mountaineer, the "Place de la Concorde
of Nature." If the phrase be meant to convey the
ideas of tranquil grandeur, beauty of form, and purity
of hue, it is well bestowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>348. Our hotel is not upon the peak of the Æggischhorn,
but a brisk morning walk soon places us upon the
top. Thence we see the glacier like a broad river
stretching upwards to the roots of the Jungfrau, and
downwards past the Bel Alp towards its end. Prolonging
the vision downwards, we strike the noblest
mountain group in all the Alps,&mdash;the Dom and its
attendant peaks, the Matterhorn and the Weisshorn.
The scene indeed is one of impressive grandeur, a multitude
of peaks and crests here unnamed contributing
to its glory.</p>

<p>349. But low down to our right, and surrounded by
the sheltering mountains, is an object the beauty of
which startles those who are unprepared for it. Yonder
we see the naked side of the glacier, exposing glistening
ice-cliffs sixty or seventy feet high. It would seem as
if the Aletsch here were engaged in the vain attempt
to thrust an arm through a lateral valley. It once did
so; but the arm is now incessantly broken off close to
the body of the glacier, a great space formerly covered
by the ice being occupied by its water of liquefaction.
A lake of the loveliest blue is thus formed, which
reaches quite to the base of the ice-cliffs, saps them,
as the Arctic waves sap the Greenland glaciers, and
receives from them the broken masses which it has undermined.
As we look down upon the lake, small icebergs
sail over the tranquil surface, each resembling a
snowy swan accompanied by its shadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>350. This is the beautiful little lake of Märgelin, or,
as the Swiss here call it, the Märgelin See. You see
that splash, and immediately afterwards hear the sound
of the plunging ice. The glacier has broken before our
eyes, and dropped an iceberg into the lake. All over
the lake the water is set in commotion, thus illustrating
on a small scale the swamping waves produced by the
descent of vast islands of ice from the Arctic glaciers.
Look to the end of the lake. It is cumbered with the
remnants of icebergs now aground, which have been in
part wafted thither by the wind, but in part slowly borne
by the water which moves gently in this direction.</p>

<p>351. Imagine us below upon the margin of the lake,
as I happened to be on one occasion. There is one large
and lonely iceberg about the middle. Suddenly a sound
like that of a cataract is heard; we look towards the iceberg
and see water teeming from its sides. Whence
comes the water? the berg has become top-heavy
through the melting underneath; it is in the act of performing
a somersault, and in rolling over carries with it
a vast quantity of water, which rushes like a waterfall
down its sides. And notice that the iceberg, which a
moment ago was snowy-white, now exhibits the delicate
blue colour characteristic of compact ice. It will soon,
however, be rendered white again by the action of the
sun. The vaster icebergs of the Northern seas sometimes
roll over in the same fashion. A week may be
spent with delight and profit at the Æggischhorn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_51">§ 51.</a> <i>The Bel Alp.</i></p>

<p>352. From the Æggischhorn I might lead you along
the mountain ridge by the Betten See, the fish of which
we have already tasted, to the Rieder Alp, and thence
across the Aletsch to the Bel Alp. This is a fine mountain
ramble, but you and I prefer making the glacier
our highway downwards. Easy at some places, it is
by no means child's play at others to unravel its crevasses.
But the steady constancy and close observation
which we have hitherto found availing in difficult places
do not forsake us here. We clear the fissures; and,
after four hours of exhilarating work, we find ourselves
upon the slope leading up to the Bel Alp hotel.</p>

<p>353. This is one of the finest halting-places in the
Alps. Stretching before us up to the Æggischhorn
and Märgelin See is the long last reach of the Aletsch,
with its great medial moraine running along its back.
At hand is the wild gorge of the Massa, in which the
snout of the glacier lies couched like the head of a
serpent. The beautiful system of the Oberaletsch glaciers
is within easy reach. Above us is a peak called the
Sparrenhorn, accessible to the most moderate climber,
and on the summit of which little more than an hour's
exertion will place you and me. Below us now is the
Oberaletsch glacier, exhibiting the most perfect of medial
moraines. Near us is the great mass of the Aletschhorn,
clasped by its névés, and culminating in brown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
rock. It is supported by other peaks almost as noble
as itself. The Nesthorn is at hand; while sweeping
round to the west we strike the glorious triad already
referred to, the Weisshorn, the Matterhorn, and the
Dom. Take one glance at the crevasses of the glacier
immediately below us. It tumbles at its end down a
steep incline, and is greatly riven. But the crevasses
open before the steep part is reached, and you notice
the coalescence of marginal and transverse crevasses,
producing a system of curved fissures with the convexities
of the curves pointing upwards. The mechanical
reason of this is now known to you. The glacier-tables
are also numerous and fine. I should like to linger
with you here for a week, exploring the existing glaciers,
and tracing out the evidences of others that have passed
away.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_52">§ 52.</a> <i>The Riffelberg and Görner Glacier.</i></p>

<p>354. And though our measurements and observations
on the Mer de Glace are more or less representative
of all that can be made or solved elsewhere, I am unwilling
to leave you unacquainted with the great system of
glaciers which stream from the northern slopes of
Monte Rosa and the adjacent mountains. From the
Bel Alp we can descend to Brieg, and thence drive to
Visp; but you and I prefer the breezy heights, so we
sweep round the promontory of the Nessel, until we
stand over the Rhone valley, in front of Visp. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
this village an hour's walking carries us to Stalden,
where the valley divides into two branches: the one
leading through Saas over the Monte Moro, and the
other through St. Nicholas to Zermatt. The latter is
our route.</p>

<p>355. We reach Zermatt, but do not halt here. On
the mountain ridge, 4,000 feet above the valley, we
discern the Riffelberg hotel. This we reach. Right in
front of us is the pinnacle of the Matterhorn, upon
the top of which it must appear incredible to you that
a human foot could ever tread. Constancy and skill,
however, accomplished this, but in the first instance at
a terrible price. In the little churchyard of Zermatt
we have seen the graves of two of the greatest mountaineers
that Savoy and England have produced: and
who, with two gallant young companions, fell from the
Matterhorn in 1865.</p>

<p>356. At the Riffelberg we are within an hour's walk
of the famous Görner Grat, which commands so grand
a view of the glaciers of Monte Rosa. But yonder huge
knob of perfectly bare rock, which is called the Riffelhorn,
must be our station. What the Cleft Station is
to the Mer de Glace, the Riffelhorn is to the Görner
glacier and its tributaries. From its lower side the
rock, easy as it may seem, is inaccessible. Here, indeed,
in 1865, a fifth good man met his end, and he also lies
beside his fellow countrymen in the churchyard of Zermatt.
Passing a little tarn, or lake, called the Riffel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
See, we assail the Riffelhorn on its upper side. It is
capital rock-practice to reach the summit; and from it we
command a most extraordinary scene.</p>

<p id="prg_357">357. The huge and many-peaked mass of Monte
Rosa faces us, and we scan its snows from bottom to
top. To the right is the mighty ridge of the Lyskamm,
also laden with snow; and between both lies the
Western Glacier of Monte Rosa. This glacier meets
another from the vast snow-fields of the Cima di Jazzi;
they join to form the Görner glacier, and from their place
of junction stretches the customary medial moraine.
On this side of the Lyskamm rise two beautifully snowy
eminences, the Twins Castor and Pollux; then come
the brown crags of the Breithorn, then the Little Matterhorn,
and then the broad snow-field of the Théodule,
out of which springs the Great Matterhorn, and which
you and I will cross subsequently into Italy.</p>

<p>358. The valleys and depressions between these
mountains are filled with glaciers. Down the flanks of
the Twin Castor comes the Glacier des Jumeaux, from
Pollux comes the Schwartze glacier, from the Breithorn
the Trifti glacier, then come the Little Matterhorn glacier
and the Théodule glacier, each, as it welds itself to
the trunk, carrying with it its medial moraine. We can
count nine such moraines from our present position.
And to a still more surprising degree than on the Mer
de Glace, we notice the power of the ice to yield to
pressure; the broad névés being squeezed on the trunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
of the Görner into white stripes, which become ever narrower
between the bounding moraines, and finally disappear
under their own shingle.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/page143.png" width="417" height="332" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption">THE GÖRNER GLACIER, WITH MONTE ROSA IN THE DISTANCE, AND THE RIFFELHORN
TO THE LEFT.</div>
</div>

<p>359. On the two main tributaries we also notice
moraines which seem in each case to rise from the body
of the glacier, appearing in the middle of the ice without
any apparent origin higher up. These at their sources,
are sub-glacial moraines, which have been rubbed away
from rocky promontories entirely covered with ice.
They lie hidden for a time in the body of the glacier,
and appear at the surface where the ice above them
has been melted away by the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>360. This is the place to mention a notion long
entertained by the inhabitants of the high Alps, that
glaciers possess the power of thrusting out all impurities
from them. On the Mer de Glace you and I
have noticed large patches of clay and black mud which
evidently came from the body of the glacier, and we can
therefore understand how natural was this notion of
extrusion to people unaccustomed to close observation.
But the power of the glacier in this respect is in reality
the power of the sun, which fuses the ice above concealed
impurities, and, like the bodies of the guides on
the Glacier des Bossons (<a href="#prg_143">143</a>), brings them to the light
of day.</p>

<p>361. On no other glacier will you find more objects
of interest than on the Görner. Sand-cones, glacier-tables,
deep ice-gorges cut by streams and bridged fantastically
by boulders, moulins, sometimes arched ice-caverns
of extraordinary size and beauty. On the lower
part of the glacier we notice the partial disappearance of
the medial moraine in the crevasses, and its reappearance
at the foot of the incline. For many years this
glacier was steadily advancing on the meadow in front
of it, ploughing up the soil and overturning the chalets
in its way. It now shares in the general retreat exhibited
during the last fifteen years among the glaciers
of the Alps. As usual, a river, the Visp, rushes from a
vault at the extremity of the Görner glacier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_53">§ 53.</a> <i>Ancient Glaciers of Switzerland.</i></p>

<p>362. You have not lost the memory of the old
Moraine, which interested us so much in our first ascent
from the source of the Arveiron; for it opened our
minds to the fact that at one period of its history the
Mer de Glace attained far greater dimensions than it
now exhibits. Our experience since that time has
enabled us to pursue these evidences of ice action to an
extent of which we had then no notion.</p>

<p>363. Close to the existing glacier, for example, we
have repeatedly seen the mountain side laid bare by the
retreat of the ice. This is especially conspicuous just
now, because for the last fifteen or sixteen years the
glaciers of the Alps have been steadily shrinking; so
that it is no uncommon thing to see the marginal rocks
laid bare for a height of fifty, sixty, eighty, or even one
hundred feet above the present glacier. On the rocks
thus exposed we see the evident marks of the sliding;
and our eyes and minds have been so educated in the
observation of these appearances that we are now able
to detect, with certainty, icemarks, or moraines, ancient
or modern, wherever they appear.</p>

<p>364. But the elevations at which we have found
such evidence might well shake belief in the conclusions
to which they point. Beside the Massa Gorge, at 1,000
feet above the present Aletsch, we found a great old
moraine. Descending the meadows between the Bel Alp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and Flatten, we found another, now clothed with grass,
and bearing a village on its back. But I wish to carry
you to a region which exhibits these evidences on a
still grander and more impressive scale. We have
already taken a brief flight to the valley of Hasli and
the Glacier of the Aar. Let us make that glacier our
starting-point. Walking from it downwards towards
the Grimsel, we pass everywhere over rocks singularly
rounded, and fluted, and scarred. These appearances
are manifestly the work of the glacier in recent times.
But we approach the Grimsel, and at the turning of
the valley stand before the precipitous granite flank of
the mountain. The traces of the ancient ice are here
as plain as they are amazing. The rocks are so hard
that not only the fluting and polishing, but even the fine
scratches which date back unnamable thousands of
years are as evident as if they had been made yesterday.
We may trace these evidences to a height of two
thousand feet above the present valley bed. It is indubitable
that an ice-river of this astounding depth
once flowed through the vale of Hasli.</p>

<p>365. Yonder is the summit of the Siedelhorn; and
if we gain it, the Unteraar glacier will lie like a map
below us. From this commanding point we plainly see
marked upon the mountain sides the height to which
the ancient ice extended. The ice-ground part of the
mountains is clearly distinguished from the splintered
crests which in those distant days rose above the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of the glacier, and which must have then appeared as
island peaks and crests in the midst of an ocean of ice.</p>

<p>366. We now scamper down the Siedelhorn, get
once more into the valley of Hasli, along which we follow
for more than twenty miles the traces of the ice. Fluted
precipices, polished slabs, and beautifully-rounded
granite domes. Right and left upon the mountain
flanks, at great elevations, the evidences appear. We
follow the footsteps of the glacier to the Lake of
Brientz; and if we prolonged our enquiries, we should
learn that all the lake beds of this region, at the time
now referred to, bore the burden of immense masses
of ice.</p>

<p>367. Instead of the vale of Hasli, we might take the
valley of the Rhone. The traces of a mighty glacier,
which formerly filled it, may be followed all the way to
Martigny, which is 60 miles distant from the present
ice. At Martigny the Rhone glacier was reinforced by
another from Mont Blanc, and the welded masses
moved onward, planing the mountains right and left,
to the Lake of Geneva, the basin of which they entirely
filled. Other evidences prove that the glacier did not
end here, but pushed across the low country until it
encountered the limestone barrier of the Jura Mountains.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_54">§ 54.</a> <i>Erratic Blocks.</i></p>

<p>368. What are these other evidences? We have
seen mighty rocks poised on the moraines of the Mer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
de Glace, and we now know that, unless they are split
and shattered by the frost, these rocks will, at some
distant day, be landed bodily by the Glacier des Bois
in the valley of Chamouni. You have already learned
that these boulders often reveal the mineralogical nature
of the mountains among which the glacier has passed;
that specimens are thus brought down of a character
totally different from the rocks among which they are
finally landed; this is strikingly the case with the
<i>erratic blocks</i> stranded along the Jura.</p>

<p>369. For the Jura itself, as already stated, is limestone;
there is no trace of native granite to be found
amongst these hills. Still along the breast of the
mountain above the town of Neufchâtel, and at about
800 feet above the lake of Neufchâtel, we find stranded
a belt of granite boulders from Mont Blanc. And when
we clear the soil away from the adjacent mountain side,
we find upon the limestone rocks the scarrings of the
ancient glacier which brought the boulders here.</p>

<p>370. The most famous of these rocks, called the
Pierre à Bôt, measures 50 feet in length, 40 in height,
and 20 in width. Multiplying these three numbers
together, we obtain 40,000 cubic feet as the volume of
the boulder.</p>

<p>371. But this is small compared with some of the
rocks which constitute the freight of even recent
glaciers. Let us visit another of them. We have
already been to Stalden, where the valley divides into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
two branches, the right branch running to St. Nicholas
and Zermatt, and the left one to Saas and the Monte
Moro. Three hours above Saas we come upon the end
of the Allelein glacier, not filling the main valley, but
thrown athwart it so as to stop its drainage like a dam.
Above this ice-dam we have the Mattmark Lake, and
at the head of the lake a small inn well known to travellers
over the Monte Moro.</p>

<p>372. Close to this inn is the greatest boulder that
we have ever seen. It measures 240,000 cubic feet.
Looking across the valley we notice a glacier with its
present end half a mile from the boulder. The stone,
I believe, is serpentine, and were you and I to explore
the Schwartzberg glacier to its upper fastnesses,
we should find among them the birthplace of this
gigantic stone. Four-and-twenty years ago, when the
glacier reached the place now occupied by the boulder,
it landed there its mighty freight, and then retreated.
There is a second ice-borne rock at hand which would be
considered vast were it not dwarfed by the aspect of its
huger neighbour.</p>

<p>373. Evidence of this kind might be multiplied to
any extent. In fact, at this moment, distinguished men,
like Professor Favre of Geneva, are determining from
the distribution of the erratic blocks the extent of the
ancient glaciers of Switzerland. It was, however, an
engineer named Venetz that first brought these evidences
to light, and announced to an incredulous world the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
vast extension of the ancient ice. M. Agassiz afterwards
developed and wonderfully expanded the discovery.
Perhaps the most interesting observation
regarding ancient glaciers is that of Dr. Hooker,
who, during a recent visit to Palestine, found the
celebrated Cedars of Lebanon growing upon ancient
moraines.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_55">§ 55.</a> <i>Ancient Glaciers of England, Ireland, Scotland,
and Wales.</i></p>

<p>374. At the time the ice attained this extraordinary
development in the Alps, many other portions of Europe,
where no glaciers now exist, were covered with them.
In the Highlands of Scotland, among the mountains of
England, Ireland, and Wales, the ancient glaciers have
written their story as plainly as in the Alps themselves.
I should like to wander with you through Borrodale in
Cumberland, or through the valleys near Bethgellert in
Wales. Under all the beauty of the present scenery we
should discover the memorials of a time when the whole
region was locked in the embrace of ice. Professor
Ramsay is especially distinguished by his writings on
the ancient glaciers of Wales.</p>

<p>375. We have made the acquaintance of the Reeks
of Magillicuddy as the great condensers of Atlantic
vapour. At the time now referred to, this moisture
did not fall as soft and fructifying rain, but as snow,
which formed the nutriment of great glaciers. A chain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of lakes now constitutes the chief attraction of Killarney,
the Lower, the Middle, and the Upper Lake. Let us
suppose ourselves rowing towards the head of the Upper
Lake with the Purple Mountain to our left. Remembering
our travels in the Alps, you would infallibly call
my attention to the planing of the rocks, and declare
the action to be unmistakably that of glaciers. With
our attention thus sharpened, we land at the head of
the lake, and walk up the Black Valley to the base of
Magillicuddy's Reeks. Your conclusion would be, that
this valley tells a tale as wonderful as that of Hasli.</p>

<p>376. We reach our boat and row homewards along
the Upper Lake. Its islands now possess a new interest
for us. Some of them are bare, others are covered
wholly or in part with luxuriant vegetation; but both the
naked and clothed islands are glaciated. The weathering
of ages has not altered their forms: there are the
Cannon Rock, the Giant's Coffin, the Man of War, all
sculptured as if the chisel had passed over them in our
own lifetime. These lakes, now fringed with tender
woodland beauty, were all occupied by the ancient ice.
It has disappeared, and seeds from other regions have
been wafted thither to sow the trees, the shrubs, the
ferns, and the grasses which now beautify Killarney.
Man himself, they say, has made his appearance in the
world since that time of ice; but of the real period and
manner of man's introduction little is professed to be
known since, to make them square with science, new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
meanings have been found for the beautiful myths and
stories of the Bible.</p>

<p>377. It is the nature and tendency of the human
mind to look backward and forward; to endeavour to
restore the past and predict the future. Thus endowed,
from data patiently and painfully won, we recover in
idea a state of things which existed thousands, it may
be millions, of years before the history of the human
race began.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_56">§ 56.</a> <i>The Glacial Epoch.</i></p>

<p>378. This period of ice-extension has been named the
<i>Glacial Epoch</i>. In accounting for it great minds have
fallen into grave errors, as we shall presently see.</p>

<p>379. The substance on which we have thus far been
working exists in three different states: as a solid in
ice; as a liquid in water; as a gas in vapour. To
cause it to pass from one of these states to the next
following one, <i>heat</i> is necessary.</p>

<p>380. Dig a hole in the ice of the Mer de Glace in
summer, and place a thermometer in the hole; it will
stand at 32° Fahr. Dip your thermometer into one of
the glacier streams; it will still mark 32°. <i>The water is
therefore as cold as ice.</i></p>

<p>381. Hence the whole of the heat poured by the sun
upon the glacier, and which has been absorbed by the
glacier, is expended in simply liquefying the ice, and
not in rendering either ice or water a single degree
warmer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>382. Expose water to a fire; it becomes hotter for a
time. It boils, and from that moment it ceases to get
hotter. After it has begun to boil, all the heat communicated
by the fire is carried away by the steam,
<i>though the steam itself is not the least fraction of a degree
hotter than the water</i>.</p>

<p id="prg_383">383. In fact, simply to liquefy ice a large quantity
of heat is necessary, and to vaporize water a still larger
quantity is necessary. And inasmuch as this heat does
not render the water warmer than the ice, nor the
steam warmer than the water, it was at one time supposed
to be <i>hidden</i> in the water and in the steam. And
it was therefore called <i>latent</i> heat.</p>

<p>384. Let us ask how much heat must the sun expend
in order to convert a pound weight of the tropical ocean
into vapour? This problem has been accurately solved
by experiment. It would require in round numbers
1,000 times the amount of heat necessary to raise one
pound of water one degree in temperature.</p>

<p>385. But the quantity of heat which would raise the
temperature of a pound of water one degree would raise
the temperature of a pound of iron <i>ten</i> degrees. This
has been also proved by experiment. Hence to convert
one pound of the tropical ocean into vapour the sun
must expend 10,000 times as much heat as would raise
one pound of iron one degree in temperature.</p>

<p>386. This quantity of heat would raise the temperature
of 5 lbs. of iron 2,000 degrees, which is the fusing
point of cast iron; at this temperature the metal would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
not only be <i>white hot</i>, but would be passing into the
molten condition.</p>

<p>387. Consider the conclusions at which we have now
arrived. For every pound of tropical vapour, or for
every pound of Alpine ice produced by the congelation
of that vapour, an amount of heat has been expended
by the sun sufficient to raise 5 lbs. of cast iron to its
melting-point.</p>

<p>388. It would not be difficult to calculate approximately
the weight of the Mer de Glace and its tributaries&mdash;to
say, for example, that they contained so many
millions of millions of tons of ice and snow. Let the
place of the ice be taken by a mass of white-hot iron of
quintuple the weight; with such a picture before your
mind you get some notion of the enormous amount of
heat paid out by the sun to produce the present glacier.</p>

<p>389. You must think over this, until it is as clear as
sunshine. For you must never henceforth fall into the
error already referred to, and which has entangled so
many. So natural was the association of ice and cold,
that even celebrated men assumed that all that is needed
to produce a great extension of our glaciers is a diminution
of the sun's temperature. Had they gone
through the foregoing reflections and calculations, they
would probably have demanded more heat instead of less
for the production of a "glacial epoch." What they
really needed were <i>condensers</i> sufficiently powerful to
congeal the vapour generated by the heat of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_57">§ 57.</a> <i>Glacier Theories.</i></p>

<p>390. You have not forgotten, and hardly ever can
forget, our climbs to the Cleft Station. Thoughts were
then suggested which we have not yet discussed. We
saw the branch glaciers coming down from their névés,
welding themselves together, pushing through Trélaporte,
and afterwards moving through the sinuous
valley of the Mer de Glace. These appearances alone,
without taking into account subsequent observations,
were sufficient to suggest the idea that glacier ice, however
hard and brittle it may appear, is really a viscous
substance, resembling treacle, or honey, or tar, or
lava.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_58">§ 58.</a> <i>Dilatation and Sliding Theories.</i></p>

<p>391. Still this was not the notion expressed by the
majority of writers upon glaciers. Scheuchzer of
Zürich, a great naturalist, visited the glaciers in 1705,
and propounded a theory of their motion. Water, he
knew, expands in freezing, and the force of expansion is
so great, that thick bombshells filled with water, and
permitted to freeze, are, as we know (<a href="#prg_312">312</a>), shattered to
pieces by the ice within. Scheuchzer supposed that the
water in the fissures of the glaciers, freezing there and
expanding with resistless force, was the power which
urged the glacier downwards. He added to this theory
other notions of a less scientific kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>392. Many years subsequently, De Charpentier of
Bex renewed and developed this theory with such ability
and completeness, that it was long known as Charpentier's
Theory of Dilatation. M. Agassiz for a time
espoused this theory, and it was also more or less distinctly
held by other writers. The glacier, in fact, was
considered to be a magazine of cold, capable of freezing
all water percolating through it. The theory was
abandoned when this notion of glacier cold was proved
by M. Agassiz to be untenable.</p>

<p>393. In 1760, Altmann and Grüner propounded the
view that glaciers moved by sliding over their beds.
Nearly forty years subsequently, this notion was revived
by De Saussure, and it has therefore been called "De
Saussure's Theory," or the "Sliding Theory" of glacier
motion.</p>

<p>394. There was, however, but little reason to connect
the name of De Saussure with this or any other theory
of glaciers. Incessantly occupied in observations of
another kind, this celebrated man devoted very little
time or thought to the question of glacier motion.
What he has written upon the subject reads less like
the elaboration of a theory than the expression of an
opinion.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_59">§ 59.</a> <i>Plastic Theory.</i></p>

<p>395. By none of these writers is the property of viscosity
or plasticity ascribed to glacier ice; the appearances
of many glaciers are, however, so suggestive of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
this idea that we may be sure it would have found more
frequent expression, were it not in such apparent contradiction
with our every-day experience of ice.</p>

<p>396. Still the idea found its advocates. In a little
book, published in 1773, and entitled "Picturesque
Journey to the Glaciers of Savoy," Bordier of Geneva
wrote thus:&mdash;"It is now time to look at all these objects
with the eyes of reason; to study, in the first place, the
position and the progression of glaciers, and to seek the
solution of their principal phenomena. At the first aspect
of the ice-mountains an observation presents itself,
which appears sufficient to explain all. It is that the
entire mass of ice is connected together, and presses
from above downwards after the manner of fluids. Let
us then regard the ice, not as a mass entirely rigid and
immobile, but as a heap of coagulated matter, or as
softened wax, flexible and ductile to a certain point."<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
Here probably for the first time the quality of plasticity
is ascribed to the ice of glaciers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> I am indebted to my distinguished friend Prof. Studer of Berne
for directing my attention to Bordier's book, and to my friends at
the British Museum for the great trouble they have taken to find it
for me.</p></div>

<p>397. To us, familiar with the aspect of the glaciers,
it must seem strange that this idea once expressed did
not at once receive recognition and development. But
in those early days explorers were few, and the "Picturesque
Journey" probably but little known, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the notion of plasticity lay dormant for more than half
a century. But Bordier was at length succeeded by a
man of far greater scientific grasp and insight than
himself. This was Rendu, a Catholic priest and canon
when he wrote, and afterwards Bishop of Annecy. In
1841 Rendu laid before the Royal Academy of Sciences
of Savoy his "Theory of the Glaciers of Savoy," a contribution
for ever memorable in relation to this subject.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> "Memoirs of the Academy," vol. x.</p></div>

<p>398. Rendu seized the idea of glacier plasticity with
great power and clearness, and followed it resolutely to
its consequences. It is not known that he had ever
seen the work of Bordier; probably not, as he never
mentions it. Let me quote for you some of Rendu's
expressions, which, however, fail to give an adequate
idea of his insight and precision of thought:&mdash;"Between
the Mer de Glace and a river there is a resemblance so
complete that it is impossible to find in the glacier a
circumstance which does not exist in the river. In
currents of water the motion is not uniform either
throughout their width or throughout their depth.
The friction of the bottom and of the sides, with the
action of local hindrances, causes the motion to vary,
and only towards the middle of the surface do we obtain
the full motion."</p>

<p>399. This reads like a prediction of what has since
been established by measurement. Looking at the
glacier of Mont Dolent, which resembles a sheaf in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
form, wide at both ends and narrow in the middle, and
reflecting that the upper wide part had become narrow,
and the narrow middle part again wide, Rendu observes,
"There is a multitude of facts which seem to necessitate
the belief that glacier ice enjoys a kind of ductility
which enables it to mould itself to its locality, to thin
out, to swell, and to contract as if it were a soft paste."</p>

<p>400. To fully test his conclusions, Rendu required
the accurate measurement of glacier motion. Had he
added to his other endowments the practical skill of a
land-surveyor, he would now be regarded as the prince
of glacialists. As it was he was obliged to be content
with imperfect measurements. In one of his excursions
he examined the guides regarding the successive
positions of a vast rock which he found upon the ice
close to the side of the glacier. The mean of five years
gave him a motion for this block of 40 feet a year.</p>

<p>401. Another block, the transport of which he subsequently
measured more accurately, gave him a velocity
of 400 feet a year. Note his explanation of this discrepancy:&mdash;"The
enormous difference of these two observations
arises from the fact that one block stood near
the centre of the glacier, which moves most rapidly,
while the other stood near the side, where the ice is
held back by friction." So clear and definite were
Rendu's ideas of the plastic motion of glaciers, that had
the question of curvature occurred to him, I entertain
no doubt that he would have enunciated beforehand the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
shifting of the point of maximum motion from side to
side across the axis of the glacier (<a href="#sct_25">§ 25</a>).</p>

<p>402. It is right that you should know that scientific
men do not always agree in their estimates of the comparative
value of facts and ideas; and it is especially
right that you should know that your present tutor
attaches a very high value to ideas when they spring
from the profound and persistent pondering of superior
minds, and are not, as is too often the case, thrown out
without the warrant of either deep thought or natural
capacity. It is because I believe Rendu's labours fulfil
this condition, that I ascribe to them so high a value.
But when you become older and better informed, you
may differ from me; and I write these words lest you
should too readily accept my opinion of Rendu. Judge
me, if you care to do so, when your knowledge is
matured. I certainly shall not fear your verdict.</p>

<p>403. But, much as I prize the prompting idea, and
thoroughly as I believe that often in it the force of
genius mainly lies, it would, in my opinion, be an error
of omission of the gravest kind, and which, if habitual,
would ensure the ultimate decay of natural knowledge,
to neglect verifying our ideas, and giving them outward
reality and substance when the means of doing so are at
hand. In science thought, as far as possible, ought to be
wedded to fact. This was attempted by Rendu, and in
part accomplished by Agassiz and Forbes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_60">§ 60.</a> <i>Viscous Theory.</i></p>

<p>404. Here indeed the merits of the distinguished
glacialist last named rise conspicuously to view. From
the able and earnest advocacy of Professor Forbes, the
public knowledge of this doctrine of glacial plasticity is
almost wholly derived. He gave the doctrine a more
distinctive form; he first applied the term viscous to
glacier ice, and sought to found upon precise measurements
a "Viscous Theory" of glacier motion.</p>

<p>405. I am here obliged to state facts in their historic
sequence. Professor Forbes when he began his investigations
was acquainted with the labours of Rendu. In
his earliest work upon the Alps he refers to those
labours in terms of flattering recognition. But though
as a matter of fact Rendu's ideas were there to prompt
him, it would be too much to say that he needed their
inspiration. Had Rendu not preceded him, he might
none the less have grasped the idea of viscosity, executing
his measurements and applying his knowledge to
maintain it. Be that as it may, the appearance of Professor
Forbes on the Unteraar glacier in 1841, and on
the Mer de Glace in 1842, and his labours then and
subsequently, have given him a name not to be forgotten
in the scientific history of glaciers.</p>

<p>406. The theory advocated by Professor Forbes was
enunciated by himself in these words:&mdash;"A glacier is an
imperfect fluid, or viscous body, which is urged down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
slopes of certain inclination by the natural pressure of
its parts." In 1773 Bordier wrote thus:&mdash;"As the
glaciers always advance upon the plain, and never disappear,
it is absolutely essential that new ice shall perpetually
take the place of that which is melted: it
must therefore be pressed forward from above. One
can hardly refuse then to accept the astonishing truth,
that this vast extent of hard and solid ice moves as
a single piece downwards." In the passage already
quoted he speaks of the ice being pressed as a fluid
from above. These constitute, I believe, Bordier's contributions
to this subject. The quotations show his
sagacity at an early date; but, in point of completeness,
his views are not to be compared with those of Rendu
and Forbes.</p>

<p>407. I must not omit to state here that though the
idea of viscosity has not been espoused by M. Agassiz,
his measurements, and maps of measurements, on the
Unteraar glacier have been recently cited as the most
clear and conclusive illustrations of a quality which, at
all events, closely resembles viscosity.</p>

<p>408. But why, with proofs before him more copious
and characteristic than those of any other observer, does
M. Agassiz hesitate to accept the idea of viscosity as
applied to ice? Doubtless because he believes the notion
to be contradicted by our every-day experience of
the substance.</p>

<p>409. Take a mass of ice ten or even fifteen cubic feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in volume; draw a saw across it to a depth of half an
inch or an inch; and strike a pointed pricker, not
thicker than a very small round file, into the groove;
the substance will split from top to bottom with a clean
crystalline fracture. How is this brittleness to be reconciled
with the notion of viscosity?</p>

<p>410. We have, moreover, been upon the glacier and
have witnessed the birth of crevasses. We have seen
them beginning as narrow cracks suddenly formed, days
being required to open them a single inch. In many
glaciers fissures may be traced narrow and profound for
hundreds of yards through the ice. What does this
prove? Did the ice possess even a very small modicum
of that power of stretching, which is characteristic of a
viscous substance, such crevasses could not be formed.</p>

<p>411. Still it is undoubted that the glacier moves like
a viscous body. The centre flows past the sides, the top
flows over the bottom, and the motion through a curved
valley corresponds to fluid motion. Mr. Mathews, Mr.
Froude, and above all Signor Bianconi, have, moreover,
recently made experiments on ice which strikingly
illustrate the flexibility of the substance. These experiments
merit, and will doubtless receive, full attention
at a future time.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_61">§ 61.</a> <i>Regelation Theory.</i></p>

<p>412. I will now describe to you an attempt that has
been made of late years to reconcile the brittleness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ice with, its motion in glaciers. It is founded on the
observation, made by Mr. Faraday in 1850, that when
two pieces of thawing ice are placed together they freeze
together at the place of contact.</p>

<p>413. This fact may not surprise you; still it surprised
Mr. Faraday and others, and men of very great distinction
in science have differed in their interpretation of the
fact. The difficulty is to explain where, or how, in ice
already thawing the cold is to be found requisite to freeze
the film of water between the two touching surfaces.</p>

<p>414. The word <i>Regelation</i> was proposed by Dr. Hooker
to express the freezing together of two pieces of thawing
ice observed by Faraday; and the memoir in which the
term was first used was published by Mr. Huxley and
Mr. Tyndall in the Philosophical Transactions for 1857.</p>

<p>415. The <i>fact</i> of regelation, and its application irrespective
of the <i>cause</i> of regelation, may be thus illustrated:&mdash;Saw
two slabs from a block of ice, and bring
their flat surfaces into contact; they immediately freeze
together. Two plates of ice, laid one upon the other,
with flannel round them overnight, are sometimes so
firmly frozen in the morning that they will rather break
elsewhere than along their surface of junction. If you
enter one of the dripping ice-caves of Switzerland, you
have only to press for a moment a slab of ice against
the roof of the cave to cause it to freeze there and stick
to the roof.</p>

<p>416. Place a number of fragments of ice in a basin of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
water, and cause them to touch each other; they freeze
together where they touch. You can form a chain of
such fragments; and then, by taking hold of one end
of the chain, you can draw the whole series after it.
Chains of icebergs are sometimes formed in this way
in the Arctic seas.</p>

<p>417. Consider what follows from these observations.
Snow consists of small particles of ice. Now if by pressure
we squeeze out the air entangled in thawing snow,
and bring the little ice-granules into close contact, they
may be expected to freeze together; and if the expulsion
of the air be complete, the squeezed snow may be
expected to assume the appearance of compact ice.</p>

<p>418. We arrive at this conclusion by reasoning; let
us now test it by experiment, employing a suitable hydraulic
press, and a mould to hold the snow. In exact
accordance with our expectation, we convert by pressure
the snow into ice.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> A similar experiment was made by the Messrs. Schlagintweit
prior to the discovery which explains it, and which therefore remained
unsolved.</p></div>

<p>419. Place a compact mass of ice in a proper mould,
and subject it to pressure. It breaks in pieces: squeeze
the pieces forcibly together; they re-unite by regelation,
and a compact piece of ice, totally different in
shape from the first one, is taken from the press. To
produce this effect the ice must be in a thawing condition.
When its temperature is much below the
melting point it is crushed by pressure, not into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
pellucid mass of another shape, but into a white
powder.</p>

<p>420. By means of suitable moulds you may in this
way change the shape of ice to any extent, turning out
spheres, and cups, and rings, and twisted ropes of the
substance; the change of form in these cases being
effected through rude fracture and regelation.</p>

<p>421. By applying the pressure carefully, rude fracture
may be avoided, and the ice compelled slowly to
change its form as if it were a plastic body.</p>

<p>422. Now our first experiment illustrates the consolidation
of the snows of the higher Alpine regions.
The deeper layers of the névé have to bear the weight
of all above them, and are thereby converted into more
or less perfect ice. And our last experiment illustrates
the changes of form observed upon the glacier, where,
by the slow and constant application of pressure, the ice
gradually moulds itself to the valley, which it fills.</p>

<p>423. In glaciers, however, we have also ample illustrations
of rude fracture and regelation. The opening
and closing of crevasses illustrate this. The glacier
is broken on the cascades and mended at their bases.
When two branch glaciers lay their sides together, the
regelation is so firm that they begin immediately to flow
in the trunk glacier as a single stream. The medial
moraine gives no indication by its slowness of motion
that it is derived from the sluggish ice of the sides of
the branch glaciers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>424. The gist of the Regelation Theory is that the
ice of glaciers changes its form and preserves its continuity
under <i>pressure</i> which keeps its particles together.
But when subjected to <i>tension</i>, sooner than stretch it
<i>breaks</i>, and behaves no longer as a viscous body.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_62">§ 62.</a> <i>Cause of Regelation.</i></p>

<p>425. Here the fact of regelation is applied to explain
the plasticity of glacier ice, no attempt being made to
assign the cause of regelation itself. They are two entirely
distinct questions. But a little time will be well
spent in looking more closely into the cause of regelation.
You may feel some surprise that eminent men should devote
their attention to so small a point, but we must not
forget that in nature nothing is small. Laws and principles
interest the scientific student most, and these may
be as well illustrated by small things as by large ones.</p>

<p>426. The question of regelation immediately connects
itself with that of "latent heat," already referred
to (<a href="#prg_383">383</a>), but which we must now subject to further examination.
To melt ice, as already stated, a large
amount of heat is necessary, and in the case of the glaciers
this heat is furnished by the sun. Neither the ice
so melted nor the water which results from its liquefaction
can fall below 32° Fahrenheit. The freezing point
of water and the melting point of ice touch each other, as
it were, at this temperature. A hair's-breadth lower
water freezes; a hair's-breadth higher ice melts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>427. But if the ice could be caused to melt without
this supply of solar heat, a temperature lower than that
of ordinary thawing ice would result. When snow and
salt, or pounded ice and salt, are mixed together, the
salt causes the ice to melt, and in this way a cold
of 20 or 30 degrees below the freezing point may be
produced. Here, in fact, the ice consumes <i>its own
warmth</i> in the work of liquefaction. Such a mixture
of ice and salt is called "a freezing mixture."</p>

<p>428. And if by any other means ice at the temperature
of 32° Fahrenheit could be liquefied without access
of heat from without, the water produced would be colder
than the ice. Now Professor James Thomson has proved
that ice may be liquefied by mere <i>pressure</i>, and his
brother, Sir William Thomson, has also shown that
water under pressure requires a lower temperature to
freeze it than when the pressure is removed. Professor
Mousson subsequently liquefied large masses of ice by a
hydraulic press; and by a beautiful experiment Professor
Helmholtz has proved that water in a vessel from which
the air has been removed, and which is therefore relieved
from the pressure of the atmosphere, freezes and forms
ice-crystals when surrounded by melting ice. All these
facts are summed up in the brief statement <i>that the
freezing point of water is lowered by pressure</i>.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> Professor James Thomson and Professor Clausius proved this
independently and almost contemporaneously.</p></div>

<p>429. For our own instruction we may produce the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
liquefaction of ice by pressure in the following way:&mdash;You
remember the beautiful flowers obtained when a
sunbeam is sent through lake ice (<a href="#sct_11">§ 11</a>), and you have
not forgotten that the flowers always form parallel to
the surface of freezing. Let us cut a prism, or small
column of ice with the planes of freezing running across
it at right angles; we place that prism between two
slabs of wood, and bring carefully to bear upon it the
squeezing force of a small hydraulic press.</p>

<p>430. It is well to converge by means of a concave
mirror a good light upon the ice, and to view it through
a magnifying lens. You already see the result. Hazy
surfaces are formed in the very body of the ice, which
gradually expand as the pressure is slowly augmented.
Here and there you notice something resembling crystallisation;
fern-shaped figures run with considerable
rapidity through the ice, and when you look carefully at
their points and edges you find them in visible motion.
These hazy surfaces are spaces of liquefaction, and the
motion you see is that of the ice falling to water under
the pressure. That water is colder than the ice was
before the pressure was applied, and if the pressure be
relieved, not only does the liquefaction cease, but the
water re-freezes. The cold produced by its liquefaction
under pressure is sufficient to re-congeal it when the
pressure is removed.</p>

<p>431. If instead of diffusing the pressure over surfaces
of considerable extent, we concentrate it on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
small surface, the liquefaction will of course be more
rapid, and this is what Mr. Bottomley has recently done
in an experiment of singular beauty and interest. Let
us support on blocks of wood the two ends of a bar of
ice 10 inches long, 4 inches deep, and 3 wide, and let us
loop over its middle a copper wire one-twentieth, or
even one-tenth, of an inch in thickness. Connecting
the two ends of the wire together, and suspending
from it a weight of 12 or 14 pounds, the whole pressure
of this weight is concentrated on the ice which supports
the wire. What is the consequence? The ice
underneath the wire liquefies; the water of liquefaction
escapes round the wire, but the moment it is relieved
from the pressure it freezes, and round about the wire,
even before it has entered the ice, you have a frozen
casing. The wire continues to sink in the ice; the
water incessantly escapes, freezing as it does so behind
the wire. In half an hour the weight falls; the wire
has gone clean through the ice. You can plainly see
where it has passed, but the two severed pieces of ice
are so firmly frozen together that they will break elsewhere
as soon as along the surface of regelation.</p>

<p>432. Another beautiful experiment bearing upon
this point has recently been made by M. Boussingault.
He filled a hollow steel cylinder with water and chilled it.
In passing to ice, water, as you know, expands (<a href="#sct_45">§ 45</a>);
in fact, room for expansion is a necessary condition of
solidification. But in the present case the strong steel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
resisted the expansion, the water in consequence remaining
liquid at a temperature of more than 30° Fahr.
below the ordinary freezing point. A bullet within the
cylinder rattled about at this temperature, showing
that the water was still liquid. On opening the tap the
liquid, relieved of the pressure, was instantly converted
into ice.</p>

<p>433. It is only substances which <i>expand</i> on solidifying
that behave in this manner. The metal bismuth, as
we know, is an example similar to water; while lead,
wax, or sulphur, all of which contract on solidifying,
have their point of fusion <i>heightened</i> by pressure.</p>

<p>434. And now you are prepared to understand Professor
James Thomson's theory of regelation. When
two pieces of ice are pressed together liquefaction, he
contends, results. The water spreads out around the
points of pressure, and when released re-freezes, thus
forming a kind of cement between the pieces of ice.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_63">§ 63.</a> <i>Faraday's View of Regelation.</i></p>

<p>435. Faraday's view of regelation is not so easily
expressed, still I will try to give you some notion of it,
dealing in the first place with admitted facts. Water,
even in open vessels, may be lowered many degrees below
its freezing temperature, and still remain liquid; it may
also be raised to a temperature far higher than its boiling
point, and still resist boiling. This is due to the mutual
cohesion of the water particles, which resists the change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of the liquid either into the solid or the vaporous
condition.</p>

<p>436. But if into the over-chilled water you throw a
particle of ice, the cohesion is ruptured, and congelation
immediately sets in. And if into the superheated
water you introduce a bubble of air or of steam, cohesion
is likewise ruptured, and ebullition immediately
commences.</p>

<p>437. Faraday concluded that <i>in the interior</i> of any
body, whether solid or liquid, where every particle is
grasped so to speak by the surrounding particles, and
grasps them in turn, the bond of cohesion is so strong
as to require a higher temperature to change the state
of aggregation than is necessary <i>at the surface</i>. At the
surface of a piece of ice, for example, the molecules are
free on one side from the control of other molecules;
and they therefore yield to heat more readily than in
the interior. The bubble of air or steam in overheated
water also frees the molecules on one side; hence the
ebullition consequent upon its introduction. Practically
speaking, then, the point of liquefaction of the
interior ice is higher than that of the superficial ice.
Faraday also refers to the special solidifying power
which bodies exert upon their own molecules. Camphor
in a glass bottle fills the bottle with an atmosphere
of camphor. In such an atmosphere large crystals
of the substance may grow by the incessant deposition
of camphor molecules upon camphor, at a temperature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
too high to permit of the slightest deposit <i>upon the
adjacent glass</i>. A similar remark applies to sulphur,
phosphorus, and the metals in a state of fusion. They
are deposited upon solid portions of their own substance
at temperatures not low enough to cause them to solidify
against other substances.</p>

<p>438. Water furnishes an eminent example of this
special solidifying power. It may be cooled ten
degrees and more below its freezing point without
freezing. But this is not possible if the smallest fragment
of ice be floating in the water. It then freezes
accurately at 32° Fahr., depositing itself, however, not
upon the sides of the containing vessel, but <i>upon the ice</i>.
Faraday observed in a freezing apparatus thin crystals
of ice growing in ice-cold water to a length of six,
eight, or ten inches, at a temperature incompetent to
produce their deposition upon the sides of the containing
vessel.</p>

<p>439. And now we are prepared for Faraday's view of
regelation. When the surfaces of two pieces of ice,
covered with a film of the water of liquefaction, are
brought together, the covering film is transferred from
the surface to the centre of the ice, where the point
of liquefaction, as before shown, is higher than at the
surface. The special solidifying power of ice upon water
is now brought into play <i>on both sides of the film</i>.
Under these circumstances, Faraday held that the film
would congeal, and freeze the two surfaces together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>440. The lowering of the freezing point by pressure
amounts to no more than one-seventieth of a degree
Fahrenheit for a whole atmosphere. Considering the
infinitesimal fraction of this pressure which is brought
into play in some cases of regelation, Faraday thought its
effect insensible. He suspended pieces of ice, and
brought them into contact without sensible pressure, still
they froze together. Professor James Thomson, however,
considered that even the capillary attraction exerted
between two such masses would be sufficient to produce
regelation. You may make the following experiments,
in further illustration of this subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>441. Place a small piece of ice in water, and press
it underneath the surface by a second piece. The submerged
piece may be so small as to render the pressure
infinitesimal; still it will freeze to the under surface of
the superior piece.</p>

<p>442. Place two pieces of ice in a basin of warm
water, and allow them to come together; they freeze together
when they touch. The parts surrounding the
place of contact melt away, but the pieces continue for a
time united by a narrow bridge of ice. The bridge
finally melts, and the pieces for a moment are separated.
But capillary attraction immediately draws them together,
and regelation sets in once more. A new bridge
is formed, which in its turn is dissolved, the separated
pieces again closing up. A kind of pulsation is thus
established between the two pieces of ice. They touch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
they freeze, a bridge is formed and melted; and thus
the rhythmic action continues until the ice disappears.</p>

<p>443. According to Professor James Thomson's theory,
pressure is necessary to liquefy the ice. The heat
necessary for liquefaction must be drawn from the
ice itself, and the cold water must escape from the
pressure to be re-frozen. Now in the foregoing experiments
the cold water, instead of being allowed to freeze,
<i>issues into the warm water</i>, still the floating fragments
regelate in a moment. The touching surfaces may,
moreover, be convex; they may be reduced practically
to <i>points</i>, clasped all round by the warm water, which
indeed rapidly dissolve them as they approach each
other; still they freeze immediately when they touch.</p>

<p>444. You may learn from this discussion that in
scientific matters, as in all others, there is room for
differences of opinion. The frame of mind to be cultivated
here is a suspension of judgment as long as the
meaning remains in doubt. It may be that Faraday's
action and Thomson's action come both into play. I
cannot do better than finish these remarks by quoting
Faraday's own concluding words, which show how in
his mind scientific conviction dwelt apart from dogmatism:&mdash;"No
doubt," he says, "nice experiments will
enable us hereafter to criticise such results as these,
and separating the true from the untrue will establish
the correct theory of regelation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_64">§ 64.</a> <i>The Blue Veins of Glaciers.</i></p>

<p>445. We now approach the end, one important
question only remaining to be discussed. Hitherto we
have kept it back, for a wide acquaintance with the
glaciers was necessary to its solution. We had also to
make ourselves familiar by actual experiment with the
power of ice, softened by thaw, to yield to pressure, and
to liquefy under such pressure.</p>

<p>446. Snow is white. But if you examine its individual
particles you would call them <i>transparent</i>, not
white. The whiteness arises from the mixture of the
ice particles with small spaces of air. In the case of
all transparent bodies whiteness results from such a
mixture. The clearest glass or crystal when crushed
becomes a white powder. The foam of champagne is
white through the intimate admixture of a transparent
liquid with transparent carbonic acid gas. The whitest
paper, moreover, is composed of fibres which are individually
transparent.</p>

<p>447. It is not, however, the air or the gas, but the
<i>optical severance</i> of the particles, giving rise to a multitude
of reflexions of the white solar light at their surfaces,
that produces the whiteness.</p>

<p>448. The whiteness of the surface of a clean glacier
(<a href="#prg_112">112</a>), and of the icebergs of the Märgelin See (<a href="#prg_357">357</a>),
has been already referred to a similar cause. The
surface is broken into innumerable fissures by the solar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
heat, the reflexion of solar light from the sides of the
little fissures producing the observed appearance.</p>

<p>449. In like manner if you freeze water in a test-tube
by plunging it into a freezing mixture, the ice
produced is white. For the most part also the ice
formed in freezing machines is white. Examine such,
ice, and you will find it filled with small air-bubbles.
When the freezing is extremely slow the crystallising
force pushes the air effectually aside, and the resulting
ice is transparent; when the freezing is rapid, the
air is entangled before it can escape, and the ice is
<i>translucent</i>. But even in the case of quick freezing
Mr. Faraday obtained transparent ice by skilfully removing
the air-bubbles as fast as they appeared with
a feather.</p>

<p>450. In the case of lake ice the freezing is not uniform,
but intermittent. It is sometimes slow, sometimes
rapid. When slow the air dissolved in the water is
effectually squeezed out and forms a layer of bubbles on
the under-surface of the ice. An act of sudden freezing
entangles the air, and hence we find lake ice usually
composed of layers alternately clear, and filled with
bubbles. Such layers render it easy to detect the planes
of freezing in lake ice.</p>

<p>451. And now for the bearing of these facts. Under
the fall of the Géant, at the base of the Talèfre cascade,
and lower down the Mer de Glace; in the higher regions
of the Grindelwald, the Aar, the Aletsch and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Görner glaciers, the ice does not possess the transparency
which it exhibits near the ends of the glaciers. It is
white, or whitish. Why? Examination shows it to be
filled with small air-bubbles; and these, as we now learn,
are the cause of its whiteness.</p>

<p>452. They are the residue of the air originally entangled
in the snow, and connected, as before stated,
with the whiteness of the snow. During the descent of
the glacier, the bubbles are gradually expelled by the
enormous pressures brought to bear upon the ice. Not
only is the expulsion caused by the mechanical yielding
of the soft thawing ice, but the liquefaction of the substance
at places of violent pressure, opening, as it does,
fissures for the escape of the air, must play an important
part in the consolidation of the glacier.</p>

<p>453. The expulsion of the bubbles is, however, not
uniform; for neither ice nor any other substance offers
an absolutely uniform resistance to pressure. At the
base of every cascade that we have visited, and on the
walls of the crevasses there formed, we have noticed innumerable
blue streaks drawn through the white translucent
ice, and giving the whole mass the appearance
of lamination. These blue veins turned out upon examination
to be spaces from which the air-bubbles had
been almost wholly expelled, translucency being thus
converted into transparency.</p>

<p>454. This is the <i>veined</i> or <i>ribboned structure</i> of glaciers,
regarding the origin of which diverse opinions are
now entertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>455. It is now our duty to take up the problem, and
to solve it if we can. On the névés of the Col du
Géant, and other glaciers, we have found great cracks,
and faults, and <i>Bergschrunds</i>, exposing deep sections of
the névé; and on these sections we have found marked
the edges of half-consolidated strata evidently produced
by successive falls of snow. The névé is stratified because
its supply of material from the atmosphere is
intermittent, and when we first observed the blue veins
we were disposed to regard them as due to this stratification.</p>

<p>456. But observation and reflexion soon dispelled
this notion. Indeed it could hardly stand in the presence
of the single fact that at the bases of the ice-falls
the veins are always <i>vertical</i>, or nearly so. We saw no
way of explaining how the horizontal strata of the névé
could be so tilted up at the base of the fall as to be set
on edge. Nor is the aspect of the veins that of stratification.</p>

<p>457. On the central portions of the cascades, moreover,
there are no signs of the veins. At the bases
they first appear, reaching in each case their maximum
development a little below the base. As you and I
stood upon the heights above the Zäsenberg and scrutinised
the cascade of the Strahleck branch of the
Grindelwald glacier, we could not doubt that the base
of the fall was the birthplace of the veins. We called
this portion of the glacier a "Structure Mill," intimating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
that here, and not on the névé, the veined structure was
manufactured.</p>

<div class="fig_caption">SECTION OF ICEFALL, AND GLACIER BELOW IT, SHOWING ORIGIN OF VEINED
STRUCTURE.</div>
</div>

<p>458. This, however, is, at bottom, the language of
strong <i>opinion</i> merely, not that of <i>demonstration</i>; and
in science opinion ought to content us only so long as
positive proof is unattainable. The love of repose must
not prevent us from seeking this proof. There is no
sterner conscience than the scientific conscience, and it
demands, in every possible case, the substitution for private
conviction of demonstration which shall be conclusive
to all.</p>

<p>459. Let us, for example, be shown a case in which
the stratification of the névé is prolonged into the
glacier; let us see the planes of bedding and the planes
of lamination existing side by side, and still indubitably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
distinct. Such an observation would effectually exclude
stratification from the problem of the veined structure,
and through the removal of this tempting source of
error, we should be rendered more free to pursue the
truth.</p>

<p>460. We sought for this conclusive test upon the
Mer de Glace, but did not find it. We sought it on the
Grindelwald, and the Aar glaciers,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> with an equal
want of success. On the Aletsch glacier, for the first
time, we observed the apparent coexistence of bedding
and structure, the one <i>cutting</i> the other upon the walls of
the same crevasse. Still the case was not sufficiently pronounced
to produce entire conviction, and we visited the
Görner glacier with the view of following up our quest.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[J]</span></a> M. Agassiz, however, reports a case of the kind upon the glacier
of the Aar.</p></div>

<div class="fig_caption">STRUCTURE AND BEDDING ON ALETSCH GLACIER.</div>
</div>

<p>461. Here day after day added to the conviction that
the bedding and the structure were two different things.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Still day after day passed without revealing to us the
final proof. Surely we have not let our own ease stand
in the way of its attainment, and if we retire baffled
we shall do so with the consciousness of having done
our best. Yonder, however, at the base of the Matterhorn,
is the Furgge glacier that we have not yet explored.
Upon it our final attempt must be made.</p>

<p>462. We get upon the glacier near its end, and
ascend it. We are soon fronted by a barrier composed
of three successive walls of névé, the one rising above
the other, and each retreating behind the other. The
bottom of each wall is separated from the top of the
succeeding one by a ledge, on which threatening masses
of broken névé now rest. We stand amid blocks and
rubbish which have been evidently discharged from
these ledges, on which other masses, ready apparently to
tumble, are now poised.</p>

<p>463. On the vertical walls of this barrier we see,
marked with the utmost plainness, the horizontal lines
of stratification, while something exceedingly like the
veined structure appears to cross the lines of bedding
at nearly a right angle. The vertical surface is, however
weathered, and the lines of structure, if they be
such, are indistinct. The problem now is to remove the
surface, and expose the ice underneath. It is one of
the many cases that have come before us, where the
value of an observation is to be balanced against the
danger which it involves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>464. We do nothing rashly; but scanning the ledges
and selecting a point of attack, we conclude that the
danger is not too great to be incurred. We advance
to the wall, remove the surface, and are rewarded by
the discovery underneath it of the true blue veins.
They, moreover, are vertical, while the bedding is horizontal.
Bruce, as you know, was defeated in many a
battle, but he persisted and won at last. Here, upon
the Furgge glacier, you also have fought and won your
little Bannockburn.</p>

<p>465. But let us not use the language of victory too
soon. The stratification theory has been removed out
of the field of explanation, but nothing has as yet been
offered in its place.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_65">§ 65.</a> <i>Relation of Structure to Pressure.</i></p>

<p>466. This veined structure was first described by the
distinguished Swiss naturalist, Guyot, now a resident in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the United States. From the Grimsel Pass I have already
pointed out to you the Gries glacier overspreading
the mountains at the opposite side of the valley of the
Rhone. It was on this glacier that M. Guyot made
his observation.</p>

<p>467. "I saw," he said, "under my feet the surface
of the entire glacier covered with regular furrows, from
one to two inches wide, hollowed out in a half-snowy
mass, and separated by protruding plates of harder and
more transparent ice. It was evident that the glacier
here was composed of two kinds of ice, one that of the
furrows, snowy and more easily melted; the other of
the plates, more perfect, crystalline, glassy, and resistant;
and that the unequal resistance which the two
kinds of ice presented to the atmosphere was the cause
of the ridges.</p>

<p>468. "After having followed them for several hundred
yards, I reached a crevasse twenty or thirty feet
wide, which, as it cut the plates and furrows at right
angles, exposed the interior of the glacier to a depth of
thirty or forty feet, and gave a beautiful transverse
section of the structure. As far as my eyes could reach,
I saw the mass of the glacier composed of layers of
snowy ice, each two of which were separated by one of
the hard plates of which I have spoken, the whole forming
a regularly laminated mass, which resembled certain
calcareous slates."</p>

<p>469. I have not failed to point out to you upon all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the glaciers that we have visited the little superficial
furrows here described; and you have, moreover,
noticed that in the furrows mainly is lodged the finer
dirt which is scattered over the glacier. They suggest
the passage of a rake over the ice. And whenever
these furrows were interrupted by a crevasse, the
veined structure invariably revealed itself upon the
walls of the fissure. The surface grooving is indeed
an infallible indication of the interior lamination of
the ice.</p>

<p>470. We have tracked the structure through the
various parts of the glaciers at which its appearance
was most distinct; and we have paid particular attention
to the condition of the ice at these places. The
very fact of its cutting the crevasses at right angles is
significant. We know the mechanical origin of the
crevasses; that they are cracks formed at right angles
to lines of tension. But since the crevasses are also
perpendicular to the planes of structure, these planes
must be parallel to the lines of tension.</p>

<p>471. On the glaciers, however, tension rarely occurs
alone. At the sides of the glacier, for example, where
marginal crevasses are formed, the tension is always
accompanied by pressure; the one force acting at right
angles to the other. Here, therefore, the veined structure,
which is parallel to the lines of tension, <i>is perpendicular
to the lines of pressure</i>.</p>

<p>472. That this is so will be evident to you in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
moment. Let the adjacent figure represent the channel
of the glacier moving in the direction of the arrow.
Suppose three circles to be marked upon the ice, one at
the centre and the two others at the sides. In a glacier
of uniform inclination all these circles would move
downward, the central one only remaining a circle. By
the retardation of the sides the marginal circles would
be drawn out to ovals. The two circles would be <i>elongated</i>
in one direction, and <i>compressed</i> in another.
Across the long diameter, which is the direction of
strain, we have the marginal crevasses; across the short
diameter <i>m n</i>, which is the direction of pressure, we
have the <i>marginal veined structure</i>.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 273px;">
<img src="images/page186.png" width="273" height="106" alt="" />
</div>

<p>473. This association of pressure and structure is
invariable. At the bases of the cascades, where the
inclination of the bed of the glacier suddenly changes,
the pressure in many cases suffices not only to close the
crevasses but to violently squeeze the ice. At such
places the structure always appears, sweeping quite
across the glacier. When two branch glaciers unite,
their mutual thrust intensifies the pre-existing marginal
structure of the branches, and developes new planes of
lamination. Under the medial moraines, therefore, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
have usually a good development of the structure. It
is finely displayed, for example, under the great medial
moraine of the glacier of the Aar.</p>

<p>474. Upon this glacier, indeed, the blue veins were
observed independently three years after M. Guyot had
first described them. I say independently, because M.
Guyot's description, though written in 1838, remained
imprinted, and was unknown in 1841 to the observers on
the Aar. These were M. Agassiz and Professor Forbes.
To the question of structure Professor Forbes subsequently
devoted much attention, and it was mainly
his observations and reasonings that gave it the important
position now assigned to it in the phenomena
of glaciers.</p>

<p>475. Thus without quitting the glaciers themselves,
we establish the connexion between pressure and structure.
Is there anything in our previous scientific experience
with which these facts may be connected? The
new knowledge of nature must always strike its roots
into the old, and spring from it as an organic growth.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_66">§ 66.</a> <i>Slate Cleavage and Glacier Lamination</i>.</p>

<p>476. M. Guyot threw out an exceedingly sagacious
hint, when he compared the veined structure to the
cleavage of slate rocks. We must learn something of
this cleavage, for it really furnishes the key to the
problem which now occupies us. Let us go then to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
quarries of Bangor or Cumberland, and observe the
quarrymen in their sheds splitting the rocks. With a
sharp point struck skilfully into the edge of the slate,
they cause it to divide into thin plates, fit for roofing
or ciphering, as the case may be. The surfaces along
which the rock cleaves are called its <i>planes of cleavage</i>.</p>

<p>477. All through the quarry you notice the direction
of these planes to be perfectly constant. How is
this laminated structure to be accounted for?</p>

<p>478. You might be disposed to consider that cleavage
is a case of stratification or bedding; for it is true
that in various parts of England there are rocks which
can be cloven into thin flags along the planes of bedding.
But when we examine these slate rocks we verify the
observation, first I believe made by the eminent and
venerable Professor Sedgwick, that the planes of bedding
usually run across the planes of cleavage.</p>

<p>479. We have here, as you observe, a case exactly
similar to that of glacier lamination, which we were at
first disposed to regard as due to stratification. We
afterwards, however, found planes of lamination crossing
the layers of the névé, exactly as the planes of cleavage
cross the beds of slate rocks.</p>

<p>480. But the analogy extends further. Slate cleavage
continued to be a puzzle to geologists till the late Mr.
Daniel Sharpe made the discovery that shells and other
fossils and bodies found in slate rocks are invariably
flattened out in the planes of cleavage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>481. Turn into any well-arranged museum&mdash;for example,
into the School of Mines in Jermyn Street, and
observe the evidence there collected. Look particularly
to the fossil trilobites taken from the slate rock. They
are in some cases squeezed to one third of their primitive
thickness. Numerous other specimens show in the
most striking manner the flattening out of shells.</p>

<p>482. To the evidence adduced by Mr. Sharpe, Mr.
Sorby added other powerful evidence, founded upon the
microscopic examination of slate rock. Taking both
into account, the conclusion is irresistible that such rocks
have suffered enormous pressure at right angles to the
planes of cleavage, exactly as the glacier has demonstrably
suffered great pressure at right angles to its planes
of lamination.</p>

<p>483. The association of pressure and cleavage is thus
demonstrated; but the question arises, do they stand to
each other in the relation of cause and effect? The
only way of replying to this question is to combine artificially
the conditions of nature, and see whether we
cannot produce her results.</p>

<p>484. The substance of slate rocks was once a plastic
mud, in which fossils were embedded. Let us imitate the
action of pressure upon such mud by employing, instead
of it, softened white wax. Placing a ball of the wax
between two glass plates, wetted to prevent it from sticking,
we apply pressure and flatten out the wax.</p>

<p>485. The flattened mass is at first too soft to cleave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
sharply; but you can see, by tearing, that it is laminated.
Let us chill it with ice. We find afterwards
that no slate rock ever exhibited so fine a cleavage.
The laminæ, it need hardly be said, are perpendicular
to the pressure.</p>

<p>486. One cause of this lamination is that the wax is
an aggregate of granules the surfaces of which are places
of weak cohesion; and that by the pressure these granules
are squeezed flat, thus producing planes of weakness
at right angles to the pressure.</p>

<p>487. But the main cause of the cleavage I take to be
the lateral sliding of the particles of wax over each other.
Old attachments are thereby severed, which the new
ones fail to make good. Thus the tangential sliding
produces lamination, as the rails near a station are caused
to exfoliate by the gliding of the wheel.</p>

<p>488. Instead of wax we may take the slate itself,
grind it to fine powder, add water, and thus reproduce
the pristine mud. By the proper compression of such
mud, in one direction, the cleavage is restored.</p>

<p>489. Call now to mind the evidences we have had
of the power of thawing ice to yield to pressure.
Recollect the shortening of the Glacier du Géant, and
the squeezing of the Glacier de Léchaud, at Trélaporte.
Such a substance, slowly acted upon by pressure, will
yield laterally. Its particles will slide over each other,
the severed attachments being immediately made good
by regelation. It will not yield uniformly, but along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
special planes. It will also liquefy, not uniformly, but
along special surfaces. Both the sliding and the liquefaction
will take place principally at right angles to the
pressure, and glacier lamination is the result.</p>

<p>490. As long as it is sound the laminated glacier ice
resists cleavage. Regelation, as I have said, makes the
severed attachments good. But when such ice is exposed
to the weather the structure is revealed, and the ice
can then be cloven into tablets a square foot, or even a
square yard in area.</p>


<p class="tdc"><a name="sct_67">§ 67.</a> <i>Conclusion</i>.</p>

<p>491. Here, my friend, our labours close. It has
been a true pleasure to me to have you at my side so
long. In the sweat of our brows we have often reached
the heights where our work lay, but you have been
steadfast and industrious throughout, using in all possible
cases your own muscles instead of relying upon
mine. Here and there I have stretched an arm and
helped you to a ledge, but the work of climbing has
been almost exclusively your own. It is thus that I
should like to teach you all things; showing you the
way to profitable exertion, but leaving the exertion to
you more anxious to bring out your manliness in the
presence of difficulty than to make your way smooth by
toning difficulties down.</p>

<p>492. Steadfast, prudent, without terror, though not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
at all times without awe, I have found you on rock and
ice, and you have shown the still rarer quality of
steadfastness in intellectual effort. As here set forth,
our task seems plain enough, but you and I know how
often we have had to wrangle resolutely with the facts
to bring out their meaning. The work, however, is now
done, and you are master of a fragment of that sure
and certain knowledge which is founded on the faithful
study of nature. Is it not worth the price paid for
it? Or rather, was not the paying of the price the
healthful, if sometimes hard, exercise of mind and body,
upon alp and glacier&mdash;a portion of our delight?</p>

<p>493. Here then we part. And should we not meet
again, the memory of these days will still unite us.
Give me your hand. Good bye.</p>
